            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE notorious increaſe of Atheiſm, Faction, and Debauchery in this and the laſt Age, is too evident to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and too miſchievous to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned without ſad reflexions: But while many expreſs their Piety in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the Matter of Fact, few do exerciſe their Conſideration, either in ſearching after the Cauſes of this deplorable Evil, or enquiring into the proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for it. 'Tis true, there may be many Cauſes of ſo complicated and ſpreading a Contagion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Methods contrived for its Cure: But there is one great and eminent occaſion of this univerſal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that ſeems to be peculiar to our Times, and the Mother or the Nurſe to moſt of thoſe Vices and Errors which are the Reproach of this Age, <hi>viz.</hi> The contempt of <hi>Excommunication:</hi> For this being the only means that the Church hath to puniſh theſe Crimes (which the Secular Tribunals ſeldom or never take Cognizance of) If Men by Ignorance or Evil Principles can arrive at Impudence enough to deſpiſe this Sacred and Salutary Penalty, they have nothing
<pb facs="tcp:205999:3"/>left to reſtrain them from committing and openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betting theſe Offences, which by this means are grown ſo general, and ſo daring, that they are the Scandal of our Reformation, the Ruin of many thouſand poor Souls, and cry to Heaven for that Judgment which upon Earth they never meet withal. It is manifeſt that the Schiſmaticks and the Prophane, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical and thoſe who are of moſt profligate Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, do all conſpire to make the Churches Diſcipline contemptible, weak and ineffectual, and all ſtrive to deprive her of that Power which they know ſhe would uſe for the Cure of thoſe Vices, which they indulge and reſolve to continue in. But it is a mighty Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to theſe our Enemies to undeceive them, and let them ſee that <hi>Excommunication</hi> is not really leſs dreadful, becauſe ſome men for vile ends do falſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it as <hi>Brutum Fulmen:</hi> And it may be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py means of reforming the Age, to manifeſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Original, the Sacred Authority, and the Fatal Efficacy of theſe Church Cenſures, which if they were rightly underſtood, reverenced as they deſerve, and prudently diſpenſed, would contribute extreamly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the rooting out of evil Principles and wicked Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and prevent the Damnation of many great Offenders, who dye in their Sins, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their Remedy, and trample on the means of their Reformation. If men truly diſcerned the terrible Conſequences of living and dying under a deſerved Excommunication, they would carefully avoid thoſe Sins which pull it on their guilty Heads; or if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily they did offend, and fall under this Cenſure, they would (as of old in the Primitive Church) never reſt till by Prayers and Faſting, Charity and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb facs="tcp:205999:3"/>they had made their Peace with God, and by a due Submiſſion to ſome Salutary Penance, obtained the Abſolution of their Spiritual Governour; and how far this would go toward the preventing or healing theſe damnable and deſtructive Offences, every man may diſcern: Impunity is the great incentive to Sin; and while the Puniſhments of the next World are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and diſtant, and thoſe which Chriſt Authorized the Church to inflict in this, are falſly thought inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, Faction and Impiety muſt grow and increaſe without remedy or redreſs, and the multitude of Offenders and frequency of the Crimes will harden the bad, and infect the better ſort, to the utter ruin of Religion it ſelf. If indeed theſe bold and merry Sinners, who are under the Church Cenſures for their real Crimes, were as ſafe as they are ſecure, it would be leſs neceſſary to give them the trouble of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but alas, the Sentence is as weighty, and more fatal when it is deſpiſed, as when it is revered, and ſhall finally fall more heavy on theſe arrogant Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, becauſe the Contempt of a Divine Inſtitution is added to all their other Iniquities, and the ſlighting of that Remedy which God himſelf appointed for their Cure, comes in as well for a Reaſon as an Occaſion of their Condemnation. I am ſure all Ages and Places, all Religions and Countries, have reverenced this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Rite, and why we alone ſhould trample on it, no Reaſon can be given, but what will import us to be worſe than Jews, Turks, or Pagans: Nor can any man in his Wits imagin that there is more liberty left to Sin, or that the Penalties inflicted for it, are of leſs weight to Chriſtians, than under thoſe exploded and falſe Religions; and therefore if <hi>Excommunication</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:205999:4"/>be dreaded there, and all the Crimes which cauſe it, is it fit that either the Faults or the Puniſhment ſhould be lightly regarded here? Whoever is of this temper, hath taken his Meaſures from falſe Guides, whoſe Intereſt it was to diſparage this Holy Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they had done ſome Crimes to deſerve it, and it is their Duty, and for their Souls health, to rectifie this dangerous Miſtake; in order whereunto we will clearly, plainly, and impartially ſhew, Firſt, The <hi>Divine Original</hi> of it: Secondly, The <hi>Univerſal Practice</hi> of it: Thirdly, The <hi>Ends</hi> for which it was <hi>Inſtituted:</hi> which will give all unprejudiced Perſons a right Notion of this uſeful and weighty matter.</p>

ALthough we conſider <hi>Excommunication</hi> as it is now uſed in the Chriſtian Church, yet becauſe it was not firſt practiſed there, we muſt dig deeper to diſcover the Foundation thereof; and it will add much to the Veneration of it, to ſhew, That it was ever reverenced, as well by the Jews as the Gentiles, before it was adopted into Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity by our bleſſed Saviour: Wherefore we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that this Sacred Rite hath its Original from theſe three things.</p>

                  <item>Secondly, From the Cuſtom of the Jews before our Lord's Incarnation.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, From the expreſs Inſtitution of Chriſt in the New Teſtament.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, The Light of Natural Reaſon ſhews us, That no Society ever did, or can ſubſiſt without Governours; nor can thoſe Governours do their duty, or preſerve the Society committed to their Care, without a Power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch as break the Rules of this Society, and commit Offences tending to the Subverſion of it; for otherwiſe the Society it ſelf muſt be precarious, and would ſoon come to ruin, as wanting ſufficient Means to preſerve it ſelf: Now ſince it is certain that Jeſus hath inſtituted a Society which is called the Church, and which is really diſtinct from the Civil State, being appointed for other Ends, and governed by other Meaſures, ruled by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Officers, and guided by peculiar Laws; a Society which did ſubſiſt when the Civil State oppoſed it, and muſt continue (whatever changes Human Governments ſuffer) unto the end of the World: Therefore the Rulers of this Society, the Church, muſt have ſome Power to puniſh all thoſe who do diſturb the good Order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by a falſe Faith or corrupt Worſhip, or by diſſolute Manners; and if our Lord had not intruſted the Church with ſuch a Power, Reaſon and Neceſſity would have compelled the Rulers of the Church to have aſſumed it, becauſe the Church cannot ſubſiſt without it. No man can ſo much as govern one Family in the Capacity of a Father or Maſter, unleſs he be inveſted with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to let in and turn out of his Family, ſuch as he ſees fit, and to diſpenſe or withhold the Benefits belonging to his Family as he ſees Occaſion; much leſs can a larger Society be maintained in Peace and Safety without the exerciſe of ſuch a Power. And as the Father or Maſter may and doth exerciſe this Authority within his own
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205999:5"/>Family, though it be a part of the Commonwealth, without damage to the Prince's Power: So in this Society of the Church, ſince the ends of it are different from that of the Civil Government, the Eccleſiaſtical Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours may exerciſe their Power and Authority without incroachment upon the Prince's Sovereignty. The ends of Temporal Princes being to preſerve their People in outward Peace and Plenty, in the enjoyment of their Temporal Rights and Priviledges while they live upon Earth: But the ends of the Spiritual Governours are to make Chriſtians holy here and happy hereafter, and their Rules and Puniſhments are both ſuted to this end. The Rules are Precepts of Piety and Charity, and the Penalties are proportionable, <hi>viz.</hi> not Corporal

               <p>§. III. The ſecond ground of excommunication is the practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by which I do not mean the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of thoſe Rabbins who lived long after the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jewiſh Polity, who have diſcourſed frivolouſly about this Rite, and loaded it with many ſuperſtitious if not ridiculous adherencies, which while ſome learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men induſtriouſly hunt after, they loſe the ſubſtance, and that which is principally conſiderable to us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; that is, The grounds we have in Scripture to prove that ſomething analogous to our Excommunication was in uſe before the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205999:9"/>muſt begin this account with the Infancy of the World, becauſe what God did in the Patriarchal times, was written to guide the Jews when they came to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church and People of the moſt High. And firſt, it is plain that <hi>Adam</hi> upon his Tranſgreſſion was caſt out of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> by the Miniſtry of an Angel, which was a ſort of excommunicating him from the place where he enjoyed the Divine Preſence in the moſt immediate manner, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> iii. 24. and ſome of the Ancients make this the firſt pattern of this Sacred Rite. Again, This Diſcipline was more plainly exerciſed upon <hi>Cain,</hi> who had been inſtructed in the way of worſhipping God, <hi>Gen.</hi> iv. 3. and making Solemn Offerings with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the reſt of that Family. But when he wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murdered his pious Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> God pronounces the Sentence of Excommunication upon him, which <hi>Cain</hi> profeſſes was an intolerable Puniſnment, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. For hereby firſt he was to be turned out of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for Religion, which he calls <hi>being hid from Gods face.</hi> Secondly he was declared unworthy to converſe with the Innocent, which is expreſſed by his being <hi>a Fugitive and a Vagabond in the Earth.</hi> Thirdly he was devoted to deſtruction, ſo that it would have been no Crime to kill him, as he complains when he ſaith, <hi>That every one who found him would ſlay him, ver.</hi> 14. Which is ſo expreſs a place, that ſome learned Men find all the kinds of Excommunication aſterwards uſed among the Jews, in this Divine Cenſure. 1. The <hi>Niddui</hi> or Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; 2. The <hi>Cherem,</hi> Anathema or Curſe; And 3ly, the <hi>Schamatha,</hi> or expoſing him to Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; For God ſet a Mark on him to reſerve the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Cain</hi> ſolely to his own inflicting: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this plainly declares that the Lord would have all wilful and obſtinate Offenders ſeparated and excluded from the founder part of the Church. And ſince <hi>Noah</hi> was the great High-Prieſt after the Flood, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that the Curſe he pronounced upon <hi>Cham</hi> for deſpiſing his Father, was a ſort of <hi>Cherem,</hi> ſince he takes

                  <hi>Japhet</hi> into the Tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> the deſigned High-Prieſt of the true God, and leaves <hi>Cham</hi> and his Race out of that bleſſed Priviledge, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> viii. 27.

And while this Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy laſted, it is no great wonder if the moſt viſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Excommunication was upon the perſons who had ſome legal impurity upon them: For all who were ſo polluted the Prieſt excluded from Sacred and Civil converſation, for ſo long a time as the uncleanneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and until the Rites for purifying had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to the Prieſts direction, and then they were admitted in again, and reſtored to their former Priviledges (ſee <hi>Levit.</hi> xiii, xiv, xv.) by the Prieſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and permiſſion. Now theſe perſons who were thus legally unclean, being unfit for that legal Worſhip, were juſtly excluded from it, and were to all intents and purpoſes in the ſtate of Excommunicate perſons du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this their Separation, as far as concerned the loſs of their External Priviledges; and if in a more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Religion the Spiritual Sword cut deeper, when it is uſed on greater Offenders, it is no wonder: But ſtill this treatment of the legally unclean by Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was a Type and Fore-runner of the Goſpel Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: And theſe natural Diſeaſes and External Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were plain Emblems of thoſe moral Impurities,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205999:10"/>which were to exclude thoſe who were Jeſus his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Diſciples, from the Aſſemblies which were to meet in his Name: And the Type was ſo clear an indication of this, that the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks even the Jews could not but make the inference themſelves, <hi>viz. That if a leprous perſon was turned out of the Aſſembly, leſt he ſhould infect others with his Diſeaſe, ſo much at leaſt ought to be inflicted on wicked and lewd Men (whoſe Examples were contagious, and their actions a reproach to the whole Society) that their Crimes ſhould be marked with a publick deteſtation</hi>

Now if the Original of this Opinion of theirs be enquired into, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it came firſt from God's threatning Diſeaſes to thoſe who tranſgreſſed his Law, <hi>Deuter.</hi> xxviii. 27, 28, 35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſecondly from the frequent Examples they had ſeen, of the miraculous ſmiting of evil Men with ſudden and ſad Diſtempers, in the very act of their Sin. Now while this extraordinary way of puniſhing and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Sinners (ſuitable to the hardneſs of this Peoples
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:205999:11"/>hearts) was made uſe of by God, there was not ſo much need nor occaſion for the Prieſts to excommunicate Men for Immoralities, ſince God took the matter into his own hands: and no doubt theſe apparent Judgments were ſo terrible, that ſuch as had done any grievous Sin durſt not come to God's Houſe till he was attoned. And it may be noted, That in the infancy of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church the Lord proceeded the ſame way with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who profaned the Holy Communion, ſtriking many of them with <hi>ſickneſs and weakneſs, and ſome with death,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 30. to warn the reſt, and to provide for the keeping his Sacred Ordinances from prophanation, in a Church where, as S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> notes, by reaſon of the Schiſm, there was no exerciſe of Diſcipline at that time: Now theſe Methods ſufficiently ſhewed it was the will of God that notorious Sinners ſhould be excluded; they did the work, and ſerved to the ends of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; they bound up the Parties, ſo that they wanted, if not commerce with men, yet however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God; for they could not go to the Temple till both the Sin was pardoned and the Sickneſs removed together: And that reſtauration was their Abſolution
<note n="(q)" place="margin">Iſa. xxxviii. ver. 22.</note>, and alſo a warning not to offend again
<note n="(r)" place="margin">John. v. 14.</note>. Theſe Methods therefore of miraculous ſmiting Sinners, might well occaſion the ſeldom uſe of any Excommunication for Immoralities, which is the firſt Anſwer to that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Why there are ſo few Inſtances of that Diſcipline under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> exerciſed by the Prieſts upon ſcandalous Offenders. A ſecond Reaſon may be taken from the Jewiſh form of Government, which was a Theocracy; God himſelf was their Supream Ruler and Law-giver, and they had not two Laws, one Sacred and the other Civil; nor two Tribunals, as there are in other Nations: The Prieſts there had the chief Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and in all other Councils, and the power of Temporal Puniſhments, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xix. 8.

                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Grot. in Luc. vi. 22.</note>. Which appoſite place I could not but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe at large, to ſhew the weakneſs of thoſe, who (not conſidering the different circumſtances of the Jews) do impoſe their Methods upon the Chriſtian Church. And this may ſhew how neceſſary it is, that there ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be in the Church ſome way and means to exclude ſcandalous Offenders; and if there be divers Methods under different Diſpenſations, that doth not take off from the uſefulneſs, or from the neceſſity of the preſent way of proceeding, which is as agreeable to the ends and deſigns of the Goſpel, as the other was to thoſe of the Law: yea, this variety ſhews it muſt always be done in ſome way or other, and makes it manifeſt that the Church cannot ſubſiſt without it. I have been the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in theſe Reaſons, becauſe the Learned <hi>Selden,</hi> and many of his far loſs Learned Followers, triumph ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in this difference, between the proceeding of the Ancient Jews and the Modern Chriſtians, and uſe this variety, as an Artifice to perſwade the World that our Cenſures are not of Divine Inſtitution, and to wreſt all Authority out of the Churches hands, that their Schiſm and ſome other Crimes (which no other Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory with us doth take cognizance of) may go wholly unpuniſhed: But as their evil deſign makes their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuſpicious, ſo I hope this fair account will ſhew it to be Fallacious; and that even while the Jewiſh Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſtood, there were Evidences enough to convince any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:205999:13"/>unprejudiced Man, that it was always God's will, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Offenders ſhould be puniſhed by thoſe who had the ordering of Religion.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, After the Jewiſh Commonwealth was ſubverted, and their Government altered by the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian Captivity, and afterwards when they were in ſubjection to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had loſt the power of the Temporal Sword, then they were obliged to make a frequenter uſe of Excommunication, and came nearer to the Form of the Chriſtian Church, as we ſhall now ſhew. <hi>There was</hi> (ſaith <hi>Grotius) a greater neceſſity of this Rite after the People became Captive, and with their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty loſt the Power of Civil Judicatures; for Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon compelled them to have recourſe unto thoſe Methods of Coercion, which they could uſe without uſurping on the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Powers</hi>

From all that hath been ſaid, we may now conclude, That from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Precedents, and from the moſt early Examples, the Jews did exerciſe this Power of Excommunication, as a Spiritual Puniſhment upon ſcandalous Offenders; the Power reſiding commonly in the Sacerdotal Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of old, and of later times in the <hi>Rabbi,</hi> who is the Maſter of the Synagogue, and that ſuch as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Cenſure were believed to be out of the Divine Favour, and unworthy of Human Converſation, till they were reſtored by thoſe who had ſentenced them. And the general dread the Jews had of this Cenſure, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Averſation to thoſe who were under it, plainly declares they did believe it was of Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and was of great Efficacy: Which being the general Notion of the Jewiſh Nation in our Saviour's time, this Opinion did make way for the receiving of this Inſtitution, as Chriſt was to ſet it up in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, of which we are next to treat.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205999:18"/>this houſhold by Excommunication for notorious and ſcandalous Offences, and conſequently to deprive them of the Priviledges which belonged to them while they were regular Members of God's Family. And as a Prince, when he makes a Deputy or Vice-Roy, uſually declares in his Commiſſion, That what he doth in ſuch a Province in his Name, and by his Power, the Prince will ratifie and confirm: So our Saviour here tells <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and in him the reſt of the Apoſtles, that whatever he binds or looſes on Earth ſhall be bound or looſed in Heaven; meaning, that he will hold their Judicial Acts for good and valid, ſo long as they keep to the Laws and Rules which he hath left them to govern by: And if any think the change of the Metaphor (from Keys which are to open and ſhut, to binding and looſing) be ſomewhat harſh, the Expoſition of S. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> doth well reconcile that difference; for he ſuppoſes the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Vice-Roy to be here ſignified

But we muſt not let the Senſe of the Fathers, and the Power of the Keys to be at once wreſted out of our hands by this Novel fancy: For firſt, the place cannot bear this Senſe, ſince it is ridiculous to affirm that Chriſt gave his Apoſtles ſuch a Power, That whatever they declared or taught to be unlawful on Earth, ſhould be unlawful in Heaven, and whatever they taught was lawful, God would make that lawful; this were to give them a power which God himſelf never did aſſume, <hi>viz.</hi> to change the eternal and unalterable Rules of Good and Evil: And beſides, in the parallel place where theſe words are repeated by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 18. they are applyed to Offenders refuſing to Repent upon the Churches admonition; which obſtinate ſinners are to be avoided as Heathens and Publicans by private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and if they value not this, as being an Act only of their Equals, Chriſt ſuppoſes his Apoſtles will then bind

But if we look back to the occaſion of them here, it will appear they can be meant of nothing but of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline: For in this xviiith <hi>Chapter,</hi> Our Lord firſt labours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the doing Injuries and Offences to the meaneſt of his Diſciples, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to <hi>ver.</hi> 14. But ſecondly, in caſe Injuries be done, or any Scandal or Offence given, Chriſt teaches the offended Perſon what method to take, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt privately to admoniſh the Offender, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. If that prevail not, the grieved party muſt rebuke him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore witneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And if this alſo prove unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the Offender remain obſtinate, then he muſt complain to the Church, which is ſuppoſed to rebuke, and if need be, to Cenſure the ſtubborn Criminal; and if he do not <hi>hear the Church</hi> (that is, ſubmit to its Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and make reparation) then Private Chriſtians are to renounce all Communion and Commerce with that Man, and carry themſelves toward him as the Jews did to a Heathen or Publican, with whom they would not diſcourſe nor eat, <hi>Matth.</hi> ix. 11. <hi>Galat.</hi> ii. 12. nor yet ſuffer them to come into that Court of the Temple where they were wont to pray, <hi>Acts</hi> xxi. 28. for on the Gate was written, <hi>Let no Stranger go into the Holy Place</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Joſeph. Bell. Jud. lib. 6. cap. 14.</note>. That is, they muſt no longer count this Man a Member of the Chriſtian Church, nor call him a Brother, but eſteem him as a Pagan, and one who never yet was admitted; or a Publican, who for living in open Sins was caſt out, and with ſuch a Man, the reſt of the ſound Chriſtians were not to have any Commerce in Civil or Religious Matters. But if all this will neither ſhame nor terrifie the wicked Wretch, ſo as to bring him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, becauſe he may think this Sentence inflicted by the Church is but an Human Act, and pronounced only by Mortal Men, Our Lord declares That this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is of Divine Authority; and though it be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced only by Men, yet it ſhall be confirmed in Heaven: For ſaith he, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:205999:20"/>&amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. And becauſe Chriſt was to be in Heaven, he aſſures them <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. That whatever Publick Acts of Diſcipline they did when they were aſſembled, and deſired his Confirmation of them, he would grant it to them; yea, when they met together in his Name, and by his Authority committed to them, did proceed to Cenſure Offenders, he declares he was preſent there virtually and effectually, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. Now here ſeems to be no room for evaſion; yet thoſe who love to find knots in the Bulruſh, do object to this plain Expoſition: Firſt, That this is meant of private Injuries when the Believers had no Judicatures to right them but Jewiſh or Heathen, and though in that Caſe they were to uſe this Method, yet now Chriſtians have Magiſtrates and Laws of their own, this order is void of it ſelf. To which <hi>Grotius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys, <hi>That Christian Tribunals do not take away the power of judging from the Church, becauſe the Civil Laws do only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the groſſer Crimes, and ſuch as are moſt contrary to Civil Societies, but there are many Offences againſt Charity, Meekneſs and Patience, not forbid by the Civil Laws, but only by Chriſt's Laws, by which the Church judgeth; ſo that</hi> Conſtantine <hi>and his Succeſſors did well to leave this power of Judging to the Church, and to confirm it by their Laws, as may be ſeen in the Acts of the Councils, and in the</hi> Code

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205999:21"/>than the Civil Puniſhments, doubtleſs they may well ſubſiſt together in the ſame Nation, without ſubverting one another. Secondly, The Learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſeeks many Gloſſes for thoſe words, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> which he ſometimes expounds of the Jewiſh Magiſtrates in the Synagogue, and ſometimes of the whole Aſſembly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly deſigning to take this Power out of the Biſhops hands: But for his firſt Notion, how improbable is it that Chriſt ſhould allow his Diſciples (who were not to ſue for their very Cloaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 40.) to go to their mortal Foes the unbelieving Jews to complain of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; and according to Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Notion of a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue for a Court of Juſtice, they were more like to be ſcourged, or receive new Injuries, than to get right there; and Chriſt would rather have ſaid, Tell it to the Synagogue, than <hi>tell the Church:</hi> But an eaſie <hi>Prolep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> will ſolve this ſeeming difficulty; for it was uſual with our Lord (whoſe words were to be writ for after times) to allude to things not then inſtituted, as he doth to Baptiſm, <hi>John</hi> iii. 5. and to the Euchariſt, <hi>John</hi> vi. 51. ſo we may reaſonably believe he gave this Rule with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe Aſſemblies of Chriſtians which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw would ſoon after grow into a diſtinct Society, and be ruled by his Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, to whom theſe Complaints were then to be made: For I muſt venture to prefer S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Expoſition before that which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> writ under a Rebellious Democracy; and that holy Father tells us expreſly, that by the Church here, is meant <hi>the Governours of the Church</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205999:21"/>
                  <hi>to remit and retain ſins, John</hi> xx. 23. 'Tis true, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Primitive Biſhops were wont to exerciſe this Diſcipline in the Preſence of the People, and with their Approbation, but the Authority was wholly in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and the Judicial Act was ſolely his; St. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> did paſs the Cenſure, and the Biſhops their Succeſſors: But they did this in and before the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for greater Solemnity, and becauſe the People were to know and avoid theſe Offenders; as alſo that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penneſs of the ſhame might make the Criminals ſooner repent, and be a more effectual warning to others not to follow ſo bad an Example: But from this preſence of the whole Aſſembly, to infer their joyning in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative part, is a very weak Conſequence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed both by Scripture and Antiquity, as we ſhall ſee in the ſequel: For this ſhall ſuffice here to prove, that in this ſecond place our Lord Jeſus hath left Power with the Governours of his Church to receive Complaints concerning ſcandalous Offenders, and to bind them with the Bond of Excommunication till they do repent, and that he hath commanded the People to refuſe all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with theſe in Sacred Civil Actions while they remain obſtinate; yea, and declared that they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main obdurate and impenitent under this Sentence, ſhall not only be excluded from Communion with the Church on Earth, but be bound in Heaven alſo, and excluded from thence if they do not ſubmit and repent. Thirdly, theſe two places being only promiſes of a future Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we may read the fulfilling of them, when Chriſt ordained the Apoſtles for Governours of his Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Reſurrection; for he ſent them with Authority <hi>as his Father ſent him, John</hi> xx. 21. and to give them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ability to exerciſe this high and holy Office he gives them the Holy Ghoſt by the Ceremony of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Finally to oblige all the Society to revere and obey them, he grants them the power of <hi>binding and looſing</hi> without a Metaphor, ſaying, <hi>Whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Sins ye remit they are remitted unto them, and whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205999:22"/>ſins ye retain they are retained, ver.</hi> 23. Which place evidently makes them Judges under Chriſt concerning ſuch Offences as are committed by thoſe in the Church, ſo that if they ſhould find any Man obſtinate in his evil ways, they might retain his Sins, that is, declare him unſit for, and unworthy of pardon, and conſequently of the Churches Communion, wherein forgiveneſs is to be obtained; and while the Offender remains impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Chriſt declares his Guilt remains on him, and his Sin ſhall not be pardoned: But if the party ſubmit and repent, ſo that the Governours of the Church judge him ſincere, and take off this Sentence, by declaring him pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, then his Sin ſhall be forgiven in Heaven, as well as his Cenſure is reverſed on Earth: Which promiſe no doubt our Saviour makes good as often as theſe his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards do judge by the Rules and Meaſures he hath given them: And ſince Chriſt gave his Apoſtles and their Succeſſors no Temporal Power, nor any other way to puniſh Offenders but this, they who would rob them of this Power, do what they can to ſtrip them of all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and bring the Church by Anarchy into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. 'Tis true, theſe words are repeated to every Prieſt in his Ordination, and the Power is committed to him ſo far as may enable him to ſerve the neceſſities of ſingle Perſons whoſe faults are made known to him by private complaint or voluntary confeſſion: But for orders ſake, where the Offence is publick, and the Scandal evident, there the Biſhop only exerciſes this Power of remitting and retaining; and it is this latter Power which only concerns Excommunication, and which was given origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to the Apoſtles as Governours of the Church: And while there are Offences and Offenders in the Church (as there will be to the Worlds end) this Power muſt remain in the Church Governours for the preſervation of this holy Society, which as Jeſus did found, ſo he hath (we ſee) taken care to endue thoſe he ſet over it with ſuch kind of Coercive Power as is neceſſary for the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thereof.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:205999:23"/>Church of <hi>England</hi> doth imitate ſome of the Forms of the Roman Church in her Excommunications; but it doth not follow therefore that ſhe derives her Right to excommunicate from the Pope or the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And for the Edicts of the Emperours which were made in favour of the Jews, there is no proof that ever the Chriſtians claimed any benefit by them, yet if they did, theſe Edicts gave them no right to Govern a Society ſet up on purpoſe to abrogate the whole Worſhip and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies peculiar to the Jews; and though they might give them a liberty (from Secular Compulſion) in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that right which Chriſt had given them, yet they did not convey that right to them. So that theſe are meer Subterfuges contrived to eſcape the force and ſtrong evidence of a Divine Right, which is ſo clear, not only from our Saviour's Inſtitution, but the Apoſtolick practice grounded thereon, to which we ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. The Apoſtles principal work was to bring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts into the Church, and yet when need required, they alſo exerciſed that other Power of Caſting notorious Offenders out of it. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom Chriſt directed his firſt promiſe of this Authority, was the firſt who exerciſed it; and the firſt Sin which he retained was the Sacriledge of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> which was joyned with a hope to deceive the Holy Ghoſt which dwelt in the bleſſed Apoſtle, and that our Lord might make his Officers Rebukes more dreadful, an immediate Judgment followed the Cenſure, for <hi>Ananias</hi> and his Wife were ſtruck with ſudden death; and the effect of this was, <hi>That great fear came upon all the Church, Acts</hi> v. 11. And though Chriſt had given no Secular Power to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, this great Example did make the Chriſtians reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Perſons, and fear the juſt Reproofs of thoſe he had ſet over them. The next Inſtance was that of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who had pretended to believe and was baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 13. but it ſeems he had diſſembled with God and Men, and only deſigned to make a gain of the Power of Miracles, which he vilely offered Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:205999:23"/>for, as if it had been only an Art which might be bought and ſold; whereupon S. <hi>Peter</hi> declares him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. ſaying, <hi>His Money and he ſhould periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi> By which Phraſe he intimates, he was (as the Jews ſpeak) under <hi>Cherem,</hi> and that he might ſeparate him from the Church, he declares <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Thou haſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part nor lot with us in this matter:</hi> which are the very words of the Tribes beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> who expreſs their fear of their Poſterity's being rejected from Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the other Tribes becauſe of their diſtance, by this very Phraſe, <hi>They will ſay unto them, Ye have no part in the Lord</hi>

When they were aſſembled for Publick Worſhip in Chriſt's Name (for theſe Cenſures, as we noted before, were inflicted in Publick to produce the greater ſhame and terror in the Offender) then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sentence which S. <hi>Paul</hi> had pronounced by the Spirit, and by virtue of that Power which our Lord Jeſus had committed to him, and which he now dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to the Rulers of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church, he chargeth them, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. to deliver this inceſtuous Man over to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that he might inflict ſome bodily pains and diſeaſes on him, to bring him to a ſenſe of his Sin, that ſo his Soul might be ſaved at the laſt and dreadful day of Judgment. As to which Phraſe of delivering to Satan, it is certainly meant of Excommunication, both here and 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> i. 20. for as by Baptiſm Men were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the power of Satan, <hi>Acts</hi> xxvi. 18. whence thoſe Primitive Exorciſms and ſolemn Renunciations of the Devil: So when Apoſtates and Evil men broke this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and were caſt out of the Church again, they were as it were delivered back to Satan, they became as Heathens, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 17. and were under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:205999:24"/>of the Prince of Darkneſs: Yet to ſhew this Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was not to deſtruction but to edification, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle declares this delivering to Satan was not for the damnation of their Souls, but that Satan (by God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and as God's Executioner) might torment their Bodies by ſome grievous Diſeaſe, whereby they might be humbled and brought to Repentance in order to their final Salvation. It is well known that the Jews generally did believe Satan was the Inflicter of all Diſeaſes, <hi>Joh.</hi> ii. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 16. <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 17. And in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the Church God was pleaſed (to give greater credit to his Apoſtles, and inſtead of Temporal Power) to ſecond their Cenſures with Diſeaſes, and ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Sentence in that Age of Miracles; and though now the Goſpel is ſufficiently atteſted, theſe miraculous Atteſtations as needleſs are withdrawn, yet ſtill thoſe who are caſt out of the Church, are really expoſed to Satan's malice until they ſubmit, and by repentance be received in again. But the Apoſtle proceeds, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. that they muſt not glory of their Purity while ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious and ſpreading Vices remained uncenſured, but <hi>ver.</hi> 7. muſt clear themſelves from theſe vicious Perſons, that they might be fit to communicate with Chriſt their Paſſoever. He alſo adds, That in a former Epiſtle (now not extant) he had enjoyned them to avoid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and converſation of Fornicators; that is, that the Church ſhould Cenſure them, and the People have no Converſation with them; but he now explains himſelf, that he means not this ſhould be extended to the Jews or Pagans, who were no profeſſed Chriſtians, and ſo not liable to its Diſcipline, and by whoſe Faults no Scandal could fall on the Church; but he now tells them who are to be Excommunicated and avoided, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe who pretend they are Chriſtians, and yet are Fornicators, Covetous, Idolaters, Railers, Drunkards and Extortion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

Now it is, in my Opinion, a very weak Enquiry to ask here, Whether this eating be meant of the Lord's Supper, or no?

<note n="(t)" place="margin">Irenaeus lib. 3. cap. 3.</note>. And truly it was uſeful and ſafe for the Orthodox Chriſtians thus totally to renounce all Converſation with theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, whoſe words might eaſily infect them if once they held communication with them. But if any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple yet remain concerning the excluding the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from Religious Aſſemblies, and conſequently from Prayers and Sacraments in the time of the Apoſtles, the Inſtance of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> will ſufficiently remove it; for he bearing himſelf as a Biſhop, would not communicate with thoſe who came from S. <hi>John,</hi> and if any did hold Communion with them, he <hi>Caſt them out of the Church,</hi> 3 Epiſt. S. <hi>John,</hi> ver. 10. or Excommunicated them, by forbidding them to come into the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, and denying to them the participation of Divine Offices, which was the principal part of the Penalty in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: And his doing this to ſuch as he counted falſe-Teachers, and Men walking diſorderly, ſhews it was frequently practiſed in that time. Thus we have ſeen how the Apoſtles exerciſed that Authority which our Lord Jeſus gave them, as often as there was Occaſion: And by what hath been ſaid we may obſerve, That they made Chriſt Jeſus the Author of this holy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the Apoſtles with their Succeſſors the ſole Miniſters thereof: That they inflicted this Cenſure for Hereſie, Schiſm, and for groſs Impieties and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and counted the Perſon who was thus Cenſured in a very deplorable and damnable Condition, and one who was no Member of the Church, and ſo would have no Communion with him in Civil or Religious Actions; yet in all this they aimed only at his Repentance, and upon unfeigned ſigns of that, the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours were ready to Abſolve him, and take him in again: which being the Pattern of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:205999:29"/>proves it to be of Divine Right.</p>
               <p>§. II. By what is Recorded in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> it doth appear, That the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated that Power of hearing Complaints, and of rebuking and cenſuring Offenders, which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt, unto thoſe Perſons whom they fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Biſhops in the Churches they had planted. And it was neceſſary they ſhould do ſo, becauſe otherwiſe they had not inveſted them with ſufficient Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Duty, nor to keep the Churches commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them in good order. And as an undoubted Proof that the Primitive Biſhops, who ſucceeded the Apoſtles, had this Authority veſted in them, we ſhall now ſhew, That they did exerciſe this Power of the Keys in the pureſt Ages of the Church, and declared they did it by Commiſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles; which (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Charity and Integrity of thoſe Ages) none can imagine they would have pretended, if it had not been really ſo. The firſt Inſtance we ſhall remark, is that famous <hi>Excommunication</hi> of <hi>Aquila</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> who had tranſlated the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> into the Greek Tongue, and who was Converted and Baptized by the Diſciples of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet continuing his former vain belief of Aſtrology, and alſo drawing Schemes of his own Nativity, <hi>he was admoniſhed and rebuked by all the Doctors of the Church for this; and not amending, but rather oppoſing them, and contentiouſly diſputing with them about Fate, they cast him out of the Church, as one unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſaved,</hi> ſaith <hi>Epiphanius</hi>

Which, with many other Canons, do ſhew that the Diſcipline of the Church was then ſtrictly obſerved, when the Biſhops had no Authority from Secular Powers, and when it was only the belief of a Divine Commiſſion granted to them, which prevailed upon the People to ſubmit to it. To theſe Canons we will add the Council of <hi>Elliberis,</hi> which was held before <hi>Constantine</hi> began to Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 305. And in this Council there are many plain Evidences concerning the uſe of this Rite; For there it is Decreed, That Apoſtates to Idolatry, Murtherers, Adulterers, and ſuch like heinous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, ſhould be Excommunicated, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church again, <hi>Can.</hi> 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Parents that marry their Daughters to Jews or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, were to be Excommunicated for five years, <hi>Can.</hi> 16. To be abſent from Church for three Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days together, was puniſhed with Excommunication, <hi>Can.</hi> 21. A Convert from Hereſie was to repent three years before he were received to the Churches Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>Can.</hi> 22. To keep Idols in their Houſes was puniſhed with Excluſion from the Church, <hi>Can.</hi> 41. And no Biſhop muſt receive any Criminal into the Church, but he which caſt him out, <hi>Can.</hi> 53. Theſe, with many other Rules there preſcribed, ſhew that Excommunication was the proper Eccleſiaſtical Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty for all Crimes, and that it was laid on for longer or ſhorter time, according to the nature of the Offence. And ſince the Biſhops who uſed theſe Cenſures, were Men of ſo great Integrity and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and many of them Martyrs for the Faith, we cannot ſuſpect they would have falſly aſſumed a Power (as of Divine Right) which Chriſt never gave them: Nor would the Faithful have ſubmitted to the ſeverities of thoſe Primitive Penances, nor have eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Excommunication ſo dreadful, or deſired Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:205999:34"/>ſo Earneſtly, if they had not firmly believed that their Biſhops Acted by Authority from Chriſt and his Holy Apoſtles. And indeed the Evidence for this Opinion in this Age is ſo clear, that Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> confeſſes it, ſaying, <hi>Excommunication was even then believed to rely upon Divine Right, and expreſs command of God</hi>

Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 139, 140. and ſaith, this is <hi>enough and too much;</hi> and ſo indeed it is; enough to confute his Novel Fancy, and too much to be anſwered by thoſe ſlight Evaſions there made uſe of: For he ſpends all the reſt of that Chapter to ſhew the Error of the Primitive Doctors in this point. Secondly, He would gladly perſwade us that Chriſtian Excommunication was a Branch of the Jewiſh, derived from it, and ſtanding on the ſame grounds with it, being the very Tranſcript of it: Yet he grants two eſſential differences; Firſt, That the Jews did not deny Communion in holy things to ſuch as were Excommunicated; but he owns that the Chriſtians did exclude them from Religious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and Offices, <hi>before the times of</hi> Origen, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, <hi>and</hi> Irenaeus <hi>alſo,</hi> Ibid. pag. 141. That is, as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we have any Records to inſtruct us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Chriſtian and Jewiſh Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (if his ſuppoſition as to the Jews be true) dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the main point from the beginning. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He ſaith every Private perſon among the Jews could Excommunicate, and hath not given one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any ſuch thing among Chriſtians, as any private Mans aſſuming this Power; yet he pretends
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:205999:35"/>he knows not when this Cuſtom ceaſed in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, which doubtleſs never began there: For he confeſſes, That <hi>it is plain in</hi> Irenaeus, Origen, <hi>and</hi> Tertullians <hi>time, none but the Governors of the Church could rightly Excommunicate;</hi> Seld. Synedr. pag. 143. yea, it is plain, That <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>it was only in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents power to Excommunicate in the Apoſtles days.</hi> As for that <hi>African</hi> Cuſtom of the Martyrs Abſolving ſome in Priſon, S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who mentions the practice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it as irregular, and it proceeded only from a Superſtitious conceit of the intereſt the Martyrs would have in Heaven, after their deceaſe, to obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the lapſed: And therefore <hi>Albaſpinaeus</hi> obſerves, their Abſolution was not thought good till after their Martyrdom: But this uſage quickly ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was nothing like the Jewiſh Cuſtom. We conclude therefore, that Chriſtian Cenſures were not grounded upon the practice of the Synagogue. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We muſt obſerve how unſeaſonably he labours to pervert thoſe places of holy Scripture, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brought to prove the Divine Right: That of <hi>Deut.</hi> xvii. 12. of putting him to death that diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prieſt, is alledged by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>

The next place, <hi>viz. Math.</hi> xvi. 19. about the <hi>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> he would evade, by pretending the Key is not an Inſtrument of Excluding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas all know <hi>it is the Inſtrument of Opening and Shutting;</hi> and he himſelf cites <hi>Artemidorus</hi> to prove it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>pag.</hi> 148. yea, he grants the Key is an Emblem of great Power and Authority among the Eaſtern Nations; and he quotes for this <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.22. <hi>pag.</hi> 147. whence it follows, That our Lord made the Apoſtles his Vicegerents and Stewards, and gave them this Power to lock Men up in the Bonds of their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:205999:35"/>Sins, and keep them out of the Church on Earth, yea, and out of the Kingdom of Heaven too, if they did not repent. Nor will Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> eaſily perſwade the World, that all thoſe holy Fathers, who thus explained this place, ſpoke that which was not good Senſe. Again, That other Text, <hi>Math.</hi> xviii. 17. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> he would have to ſignifie, <hi>Tell it to the Jewiſh Conſistory;</hi> as if our Saviour would ſend his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Diſciples to complain to their Mortal Foes, who would injure them much more: And though he uſe a groſs Prolepſis in explaining <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Goſpel, by the Talmudical Phraſes of later date, and by Modern Tranſlations, yet he will not allow an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Prolepſis to the Fathers, who think Chriſt ſpake with reſpect to the Chriſtian Church ſhortly to be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and which was to continue to the end of the World; Nor a Common Trope, by which the name of the Society is put for the Governing part. In the ſame verſe, He labours to prove that Heathens and Publicans were not interdicted the Jewiſh Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; now by Heathens, is not meant Proſelytes, but Idolaters, the Proſelytes being called by a gentler Name: And theſe Idolatrous Heathens were denied acceſs to all parts of the Temple which were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Holy, as we ſhewed before; and the pious Jews would neither eat nor willingly converſe with them nor Publicans, often blaming our Saviour for doing this, though only in order to their Converſion: So that our Lord means that they muſt have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with thoſe who would not repent upon the Churches Admonition. So for binding and looſing, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 18. (which the Ancients make one main ground of Excommunication) he forgets Chriſts own Expoſition of it, <hi>by remitting and retaining Sins,</hi> and runs out into the later Rabinical Notion of <hi>Permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and prohibiting as a Teacher;</hi> which cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this place of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where Chriſt is not ſpeaking of his Apoſtles determining in the Schools,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:205999:36"/>or ſolving Caſes of Conſcience, but of the power they ſhould have to puniſh contumacious Offenders and injurious Perſons. And though Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> objects, it is not <hi>Whoſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> but <hi>Whatſoever;</hi> yet he anſwers himſelf, ſaying, <hi>That it is true, Perſons may be ſignified by the Neuter Gender: pag.</hi> 159. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, For his Fancy that the force of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depended on private Pacts among the Chriſtians; it is not to be imagined that Murderers and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, perjured Perſons and Apoſtates, would have ſcrupled breaking theſe parts, or have been ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and dejected by an Excommunication, if it had only relied on their own promiſe to obey it. I grant indeed, the Chriſtians did vow in Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, to obſerve Chriſts Commands, and ſubmit to his Injunctions, among which doubtleſs they reckoned this ſo much reverenced Diſcipline, to which they were ſubject, for that they believed it to be exerciſed in Chriſts Name, and by vertue of his Authority: We conclude therefore, That Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> hath gained nothing by this prolix Excurſion, but only to convince us that he wiſhed Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were not of Divine Right, though he be not able to prove it; And no queſtion we are much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in believing with thoſe Holy Primitive Biſhops, who might know the mind of Chriſt, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles much better than our Modern Criticks, and who are more likely to tell us the Truth, than thoſe who eſpouſe a Party, and ſerve Ends of Revenge, for Cenſures not undeſervedly laid upon them.</p>
               <p>§. III. Our next Enquiry as to practice is, Whether this Rite of Excommunication was uſed and believed of Divine Right after the Empire became Chriſtian: And this we muſt do the more largely to confute the Error of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> (eſpouſed alſo by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:205999:36"/>to prove, That in a Chriſtian State there is no need of any ſuch thing as a power of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church-men, becauſe the Magiſtrate now may puniſh all Crimes; and that it was only for Want of this bleſſing of Chriſtian Magiſtrates which forced the Primitive Biſhops to uſe Excommunication. To which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> adds, That after the Empire became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the Biſhops derived their Power to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from the Princes Grant. There is no better way to find out the truth herein, than to conſult the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of thoſe Ages, and to enquire into the Opinion of the moſt eminent Fathers after <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, and into the practice of thoſe Ages which retained the Primitive purity. And though we cannot bring in all things of this kind between the years 300. and 500. (for that would be to write a Church Hiſtory, not a Diſcourſe upon one ſingle point) Yet we will remark that which is ſufficient to baffle this modern and ill grounded Conceit. And firſt, Whereas it is moſt certain that the Biſhops did Excommunicate in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's</hi> time, yet no Writer of that Age doth affirm they did it by any Power from the Emperor; and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> out of his vaſt ſtock of reading (at this dead lift) could not bring one ſingle Memorial of the Emperors giving the Biſhops a Power to Excommunicate in all this Period of time. 'Tis true, theſe firſt Chriſtian Emperors, and <hi>Constantine</hi> particularly, did Ordain, <hi>That if any</hi> Litigants <hi>deſired to have their cauſes tried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhops, they might leave the Secular Tribunal, and that the Biſhops Sentences ſhould be firm, and of more Authority than thoſe of other Judges, yea, as valid as if they were delivered by the Emperor himſelf. As alſo, that the Magiſtrates and their Officers ſhould execute their Sentences, and that the Decrees of their Councils ſhould be Valid</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Sozomen. hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. 1. cap. 9. p. 206. Circa <hi>An.</hi> 314. Vide Cod. Theodoſ. l. 16. Tit. 2. in fine.</note>. Which Law doth indeed give them a New Power not granted by Chriſt, but never mentions Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; Yea, it ordains that theſe Sentences ſhould be executed by another method, even by the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:205999:37"/>Civil Magiſtrate and his Officers. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> indeed produces another Law (as if it were a Repeal of this) in the time of <hi>Valens, Gratian,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian, Ann.</hi> 376. above 60. years after. But that Law ſeems to except only Criminal Actions from the Biſhops Cognizance
<note n="(s)" place="margin">Vid. Seld. Synedr. l. 1. cap. 10. p. 187.</note>. And if we conſider the complaints of the good Biſhops in that Age, who were burthened with divers Civil Cauſes, or look upon thoſe Laws of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi>
                  <note n="(t)" place="margin">Cod. Juſtin. lib. 1. Tit. 4. de Epiſt. Aud. L. 7. <hi>An.</hi> 398. &amp; L. 8. <hi>An.</hi> 408.</note>, and of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius, which allow Men to chuſe Biſhops for deciding their Civil Cauſes,</hi> and <hi>declare their Sentence to be firm and Valid,</hi> We ſhall eaſily perceive that <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Law was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, nor this practice difuſed. But this doth not at all belong to Excommunication, which Power the Biſhops exerciſed by the virtue of Chriſts Commiſſion in caſes of Hereſy and Scandal, and that not by conſent of the Parties, as they did this Power of deciſion of Civil Cauſes. So that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ought not to make Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depend. on theſe grants: For the Emperors Authority did not precede, but follow the Biſhops Act in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; ſo that if the perſon Cenſured pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved obſtinate or troubleſome, he was Baniſhed or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by the Imperial Power. As we ſee in the Caſe of the <hi>Arians,</hi> who were Excommunicated by the firſt General Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did Ordain, That thoſe who ſubmitted not to the Decree of the Council, ſhould be baniſhed
<note n="(u)" place="margin">Sozom Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. hiſt. lib. 1. cap. 19. p. 221.</note>. And that the Biſhops did exerciſe this Power in their own right, as derived from Chriſt, is manifeſt from the whole Hiſtory of that Age; <hi>Arius</hi> himſelf, and all his <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> were Excommunicated at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> firſt by <hi>Peter,</hi> and then by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Biſhops of that City
<note n="(w)" place="margin">Idem ibid. Cap. 14. p. 215.</note>, before any application was made to the Emperors, and before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was Called: And that moſt famous Council, in almoſt every Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, ſuppoſes the Biſhop to be the Judge of ſuch as are to be kept out, and ſuch as are to be let into the Church.

To this we may add that Accurate Scheme of the admirable Diſcipline of theſe Primitive Ages, which is deſcribed in the Canonical Epiſtles of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thaumaturgus,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and others of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Biſhops: By which we ſee, that ſuch as were firſt Excommunicated by the Biſhops for Fornication, Adultery, Murder, Perjury, Apoſtaſie, and other Crimes
<note n="(x)" place="margin">Vid. Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Allatium de Narthece Vet. Eccl. §. 19. p. 94. Et Bevereg. Not. ad. Can. xi. Concil. Nicaen.

For they made four Orders of theſe Penitents. Firſt, The Mourners, who ſtood without the Church, Lamenting their Sins in Sackcloth and Aſhes, kneeling down to the Prieſts and Faithful, who went in, and begging their Prayers for them. When they had continued under this ſevere Diſcipline one or more years, according to the nature of their offence, they were then let in to the Church-Door, and ſtood there below among the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> and heard the Scriptures read and Preached (whence they were called, <hi>Hearers);</hi> and then theſe were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of the Church for ſome Years. After this they were admitted into the lower part of the inner Temple, where the Faithful ſtood, but ſo as that they were to fall down proſtrate to beg Pardon of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop (and therefore they were called <hi>the Proſtrate</hi>) and theſe alſo were ſent away after the Prayer for Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents was ſaid over them. Laſtly, The Biſhop admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to ſtand up among the Faithful, and ſtay all the time of Prayers among them; Yet ſo as they were ſtill excluded from the Participation of the holy Sacrament, and theſe were called <hi>The Standers up:</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:205999:38"/>In which ſtate having continued a while, they were Abſolved, and admitted to full Communion, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the bleſſed Euchariſt. Now this whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of theſe Orders of Penitents, which is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned in all the Authors of this Age, that we cannot underſtand any of them without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; I ſay, all this was determined only by Eccleſiaſtical Canons, and by the Biſhops Authority, without any Grant from the Emperors, yet it was freely ſubmitted to by all good Chriſtians; and is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable proof, That the whole Church did then believe Biſhops had Power from God to expel Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Sacred Aſſemblies and Offices, and that they only could bind and looſe: This ſhews they doubted not, but that ſuch as were Excommunicated by the Biſhop, were in danger of damnation, and till they became Penitent, were as Heathens and Publicans, and in a worſe Eſtate than the new Converts not yet Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. And ſince this Diſcipline began before the Empire was Chriſtian, and continued long after it, without any Grant from the Secular Powers, it follows, That it was Founded Originally on a Divine Right, which great Truth we will now further confirm from the Practice and Opinion of the moſt eminent Holy Biſhops of theſe Ages. St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> Excommunicated one of the Emperors Prefects, who did much oppreſs the Churches of <hi>Libya,</hi> and certified S. <hi>Baſil</hi> of it by his Letter; whereupon S. <hi>Baſil</hi> alſo excommunicated the ſame Perſon in his Church

Where we may obſerve the Cuſtom of Biſhops ſending Epiſtles to other Churches, that they alſo might avoid the Communion of ſuch as they had Excommunicated; Of which we have a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable inſtance in S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who Excommunicated <hi>Primianus</hi> the <hi>Donatist,</hi> and ſent his <hi>Tractatorian</hi> Letter to all his fellow Biſhops to avoid him

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:205999:39"/>who have Anathematized Soveraign Princes, and ſtirred up Foreign Force againſt them, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited their own Subjects to Perjury and Rebellion; yea, to Murder them, and take their Kingdoms from them; Which is to turn the Spiritual into a Carnal Sword, and proſtitute a Divine Inſtitution to ſerve the ends of Avarice, Injuſtice, and Ambition; Yea, to uſe it to quite contrary purpoſes than Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it for, <hi>viz.</hi> to make it to ſerve for Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not for Edification.

This is ſo direct and full to our purpoſe, that we need not ſeek any further to aſſure us That S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> did believe the power of Excommunication was from Chriſt, and that it was granted only to the Biſhops and was of great uſe in the Church. Many more paſſages in him do confirm theſe Truths; but omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, we go on to his Contemporary S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who fully agrees with him in this Opinion: For ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Clergy, as they are diſtinct from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, he ſaith, <hi>God forbid I ſhould ſpeak evil of theſe who ſucceed the Apoſtles, and conſecrate the Body of Christ with their Mouths, who make us Chriſtians, and having received the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, do in a ſort judge before the day of Judgment.</hi> And ſoon after he ſaith, <hi>They have power to deliver a man to Sathan for the deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of the Lord Jeſus</hi>

And we may alſo here remark, That all thoſe places which we produced before out of Scripture to prove the Divine Right of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, are ſo expounded and applied by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But to proceed with S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> He having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Vigilantius</hi> an Heretick, wonders very much, Why he was not Excommunicated by his own Biſhop
<note n="(s)" place="margin">Hieron. ep. 53. adverſ. Vigil. Tom. II. pag. 154.</note>. And ſpeaking of <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> who had undeſervedly cenſured (as he thought) ſome who held the right Faith, he there informs us wherein
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:205999:41"/>the Cenſure did conſiſt: For he ſaith, that this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>had prohibited them to enter into the Church, and forbid any to receive them into their Houſes while they lived, or to bury them when they were dead</hi>
                  <note n="(t)" place="margin">Hieron. adv. error. Joan. Hi. Tom. II. pag. 258.</note>.

                  </note>. Yea, he grounds the right of Excommunication up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the expreſs commands of Chriſt, and of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtles, affirming, That as <hi>Phineas</hi> under the Law ſlew the Adulterers, ſo now the viſible Sword is ceaſed from the Church, we do the ſame thing by Excommunication
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Idem de fide &amp; oper. cap. 2. Tom. IV. pag. 13.</note>; which in another place,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:205999:41"/>he ſaith, <hi>doth the ſame under the Goſpel, as putting to death did under the Law</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Id. quaeſt. in Deut. lib. 5. Tom. IV. pag. 62.</note>. Again, he reckons up three deadly Sins which are eſpecially to be puniſhed with Excommunication, Uncleanneſs, Apoſtaſie and Murder
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Idem de fide &amp; oper. cap. 19.</note>. And for his Senſe of the efficacy of this Divine Sentence, he teacheth, That <hi>When the Church doth Excommunicate, the perſon is bound in Heaven; and when he is reſtored by the Church, this reconciliation makes him looſed in Heaven</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Idem Tract. in Johan. 50. Tom. IX. pag. 80. <hi>(b).</hi>
                  </note>. Which he proves by Chriſts promiſe to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him to the whole Church, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> there obſerves, And to the ſame purpoſe in another place, <hi>The Church which is founded on Chriſt, did from him, in</hi> Peter, <hi>receive the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, that is, the power of binding and looſing Sins</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Idem Tract. 124. ibid. p. 123.</note>. And it is obſervable, that this Eminent Father always grounds Excommunication upon the power of <hi>Binding and Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which Chriſt gave the Church: As in that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle where he reproves a young Biſhop, <hi>Auxilius,</hi> for Excommunicating a whole Family for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters fault, by which means (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> notes) if a Child ſhould be born in that Houſe, it could not be baptized, no not though it were in danger of Death; ſuch was the force of this Sentence; which he there calls <hi>A Spiritual Penalty binding the Soul, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of our Saviour; Whatſoever ye bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Aug. Epiſt. 75. Tom. II. pag. 71. <hi>(a).</hi>
                  </note>. So that we ſee this was the conſtant and currant Opinion of the whole Church, and thus the moſt eminent Fathers did expound holy Scripture: Here therefore we might conclude, but only we muſt not omit that ſolemn Inſtance of <hi>Syneſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ptolemais</hi> his Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating <hi>Andronicus</hi> the Prefect of <hi>Pentapolis</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> under <hi>Theodoſius, An.</hi> 411. for horrible Impieties and Cruelties which he and his Companions had been guilty of; the Form of which is contained in the Tractatorian Epiſtle, which the Biſhop ſent in the name of the Church of <hi>Ptolemais</hi> to all her Siſter
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:205999:42"/>Churches throughout the World, in theſe Words; <hi>Let no Church of God be open to</hi> Andronicus <hi>and his Companions, to</hi> Thoas <hi>and his Aſſociates, let every holy place, Chappel and Church-yard be ſhut against them: The Devil hath no part in</hi> Paradiſe, <hi>and if he privily creep in, he would be caſt out again: I therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh all private perſons and Rulers, that they neither dwell in the ſame Houſe, nor eat at the ſame Table with them; And eſpecially, I charge all Prieſts neither to ſpeak to them while they live, nor attend them to their Graves when they dye: And if any deſpiſe this as the Church of a little City, and Communicate with theſe Excommunicate Perſons, as if he need not obey ſo poor a Place, he makes a Schiſm in the Church, which Christ would have to be but one: And if he be a Deacon, Prieſt, or Biſhop, we will account him in the ſame state with</hi> Andronicus, <hi>and will never ſhake hands or eat with ſuch a Man, much leſs will we Communicate with them- in the holy Mysteries, who take part with</hi> Thoas <hi>and</hi> Andronicus
<note n="(g)" place="margin">Syneſij Epiſt. 58. pag. 203. An. 411.</note>. Where we ſee how ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Excommunicate Perſons were to be avoided, and how perfectly they were excluded from all Civil and Religious Converſe and Communion: Yea <hi>Syneſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man ought to call or count</hi> Andronicus <hi>for a Christian</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Idem ibid. pag. 201.</note>; for this put him into the ſtate of a Heathen, and wholly cut him off from the Body of Chriſts Church.

                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Syneſij Ep. 67. Theophil. pag. 215.</note>; Which manifeſtly ſhews that he eſteemed it a dreadful thing for any to dye under this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and that it might make their Eſtate very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:205999:42"/>in another World: and therefore it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful how Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> could infer, <hi>That this looks as if he thought this Bond not of Divine Inſtitution, but of Humane Invention</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Seld. Synedr. 1. cap. 13. p. 285.</note>; For it proves the contrary: ſince if it were only a Humane Invention, it is no matter whether it were taken off or no, from one who is bidding adieu to Mankind; nor could it be any prejudice to a Man at Gods Tribunal, if it were not laid on by his Authority: Therefore it was this belief which made the Old Canons ſo careful to reſtore thoſe who had not fully gone through the Degrees of Penitence, unto the Communion of the Church, in caſe of mortal Sickneſs, leſt if they died bound on Earth, they ſhould be bound in Heaven. Soon after lived <hi>Proſper, An.</hi> 433. who ſaith, <hi>The greater Sinners must be ſharply rebuked, and if this will not bring them to amendment, as rotten Members of the Body, they are to be cut off by Excommunication, lest like to dead Fleſh not taken away, they corrupt the ſound parts</hi>
                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">Proſper de vit. contempl. lib. 2. cap. 7.</note>. It would be tireſome to my ſelf and the Reader to ſearch any further in ſo undeniable and clear a Matter, and therefore without enquiring any further into the declining Ages of the Church, We will here conclude, That it was the Senſe of the Primitive Catholick Fathers, That Excommunication was exerciſed by Divine Right, and by Authority derived from Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>§. IV. We will now go on to conſider the Senſe of the Councils in this Period concerning Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And out of innumerable inſtances there, of the uſe of this Rite, we will only ſelect the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. And firſt upon that Principle, That the Whole Catholick Church was but one, and that whoſoever was caſt out by any one Biſhop was cut off from the Body of Chriſt; The <hi>Nicene</hi> Council decreed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an Ancient Canon (meaning the 32 Canon Apoſtolical) <hi>That whoſoever was caſt out by one Biſhop,

By which they declared that they believed Chriſt had given the power of judging to every Biſhop, as to all thoſe under his Charge; and yet ſince Biſhops were but Men, and might chance to vary from thoſe rules which Chriſt had left them to judge by, through Paſſion, or Partiality, this Great Council provides, That if any be unjuſtly Excommunicated, the matter ſhall upon Appeal be tried in a Synod of neighbouring Biſhops, to be held twice in each year, and there the Caſe is to be tried finally. And the like Order of not receiving thoſe into one Church, who were caſt out of another, without the Sentence of a Synod of Biſhops, is renewed in all ſucceeding Councils

Which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proves, That Excommunication was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be the Biſhops Office, and that this power was derived from Chriſt, and founded upon thoſe Words of the Goſpel which we have cited before. It were endleſs to cite all the Councils which menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Sacred puniſhment, becauſe it is mentioned in every one: But it may be worth obſerving, That in the famous General Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which was confirmed by the Emperors Authority, there are Decrees for Excommunicating ſome Offenders, and for Anathematizing others
<note n="(n)" place="margin">An. 450. Concil. Chalced. Can. 2, 4, 7, 8, 15, 16, 20. &amp; 27.</note>.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:205999:46"/>the Civil Powers gave them the force of Laws, and by Temporal Penalties compelled Men to obey the Canons; which is one great end of Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> confeſſeth out of <hi>Iſidore: The Magiſtrates would not be neceſſary in the Church, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that what the Prieſt cannot effect by the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Magiſtrate may cauſe to be done by the Terror of his Diſcipline</hi>

But to proceed; It was a manifeſt Sign that theſe Ages did believe Excommunication had its effect upon Mens Souls, and not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them out of the Society of Chriſtians upon Earth, but alſo put them into extream danger of Damnation in the next World; becauſe in all the Old Councils ſuch care is taken, that none who had ſubmitted to Penitence ſhould dye without being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and admitted to the Holy Communion; for their reſtoring to the Communion of the Viſible Church could ſignifie little to them, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to walk abroad again, or to come to the Church any more; wherefore this was intended to prevent the ſad effects which this Sentence unrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed might have upon them in another World, as being laid on by the Authority of Chriſt. The old Canons which take this care, may be ſeen together in <hi>Albaſpinaeus:</hi> But the ſame Proviſo was made in the Councils of this Age alſo, <hi>viz. That ſuch as were Excommunicated, and fell into Mortal Sickneſs, ſhould have the Sacrament before they died</hi>

                  </note>. And here alſo I muſt note, That about this time there was a Cuſtom Annually to Excommunicate ſome kind of Notorious Offenders, which is mentioned in the third Council of <hi>Orleance</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">An. 540. Concil. 3. Aurel. Can. 13. &amp; Can. 30.</note>, though ſome would pretend it to be a Cuſtom of later times only.

                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">An. 506. Concil. Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſ. Can. 15.</note>, <hi>none were to eat with them</hi>

So that we may ſee the Ancient Diſcipline was ſtill in force, until the year 600 after Chriſt, and that with little or no Variation, unleſs in the dealing more gently with Penitents, becauſe the World could ſcarce bear thoſe ancient ſeverities ſo many years together. After this, we may obſerve out of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, that it was then the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion, <hi>That Biſhops held the place of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and they who had obtained this Degreee for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, had received the power of Binding and Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: — Yea, that whether the Paſtor laid on this Bond juſtly or no, it was to be dreaded by thoſe of his Flock</hi>

And in his Epiſtles, which paſſed for Law through divers Ages, there are many Inſtances of the exerciſe of this Power, which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> would not have any Biſhop uſe raſhly, nor to revenge his private wrongs, becauſe it was deſigned for more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ends
<note n="(y)" place="margin">Greg. M. Epiſt. lib. 2. ind. XI. ep. 45. Item ibid. ind. c. X. Ep. 34.</note>. And it ſeems the Pope did not then pretend a General Commiſſion to Abſolve all that other Biſhops Excommunicated; for he gives this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he Abſolves one of <hi>Milan,</hi> becauſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop who cenſured him, was dead, and no Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor choſen

However, it is certain, that the uſe of this Cenſure came into this Nation with their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: And that Almighty God did ſhew his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon thoſe who deſpiſed this Sentence, which was pronounced in his Name, may be ſeen in that memorable Example related by <hi>Beda,</hi> who tells us, That S. <hi>Chad</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Eaſt-Saxons,</hi> Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated one of King <hi>Sigebert's</hi> Earls for an unlawful

And this theſe Chriſtian Princes were obliged to do by their office; and they did it without infringing the Biſhops Divine Right at all: For though a Parent by Divine Right have power over his Children, yet without taking away that Right the State may direct Parents how to manage that power. And beſides it may be obſerved, That none of the Princes did ever pretend, either to grant the Biſhops this power or wholly to forbid them to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it; only they direct them to manage it warily and wiſely, and as they ought to have managed it, if no ſuch Rules had been given them.

               <p>§. V.

<note n="(u)" place="margin">Seld Syned. l. I. cap. 10. p. 187, 188.</note>. But <hi>Sozomen</hi> a more Authentick Author gives us a Copy of their Petition or Recantation offered to the Biſhops, in the end of which they deſire upon their repentance <hi>That theſe Biſhops will put the Emperor in mind of them, and let him know their intentions, and that they will pleaſe ſpeedily to determine what they ſhall think expedient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them</hi>

So that it was the Biſhops alone who could abſolve them from the Excommunication, only ſince they were baniſhed by the Emperors Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he was to be requeſted to take off that Penalty which he laid on, and to let, them return to their Churches, when the Biſhops had accepted their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and taken off the Eccleſaſtical cenſure. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He takes much Pains to prove the Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time till <hi>Gratians, viz.</hi> for about 60 years, had the Title and office of <hi>Pontifices Maximi,</hi> and the ſupreme Power in matters relating to Religion; and conſequently he ſuppoſes the Biſhops muſt Excommunicate by delegation from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<note n="(x)" place="margin">Seld. ibid. p. 178. ad p. 188.</note>. For the Title, I ſhall eaſily grant that they bore it; But his inference from it I muſt utterly deny, ſince there is not (in all Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> reading) One line produced out of Antiquity to ſhew That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors did delegate this power to the Biſhops; no Edict, no Law, nor Reſcript, no Hiſtorian ever mentioned ſuch a thing; no Council, no Biſhops were ever ſo grateful as to own this great favour; ſo that it is a meer <hi>Chimaera.</hi> The Biſhops did Excommunicate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Government, and under it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it in the ſame manner, and (as hath been ſhewed) even then declared their power was from God: 'Tis true, the admitting them to ſit as Judges in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes was by delegate power from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,

Thirdly, he mentions thoſe Phraſes in the Imperial Laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Hereticks, who deny the Nicene Faith, <hi>are to be driven and removed from the threſholds of all Churches, and not to be permitted to meet in any Church, to be forbid the Communion of Saints, and excluded the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note n="(y)" place="margin">Seld. Synedr. L. I. cap. 10. p. 172.</note> which he would have to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy an Imperial Excommunication; but the intelligent Reader knows, that the Biſhops in Council had firſt decreed this Excommunication, and that by vertue of an expreſs divine Precept, <hi>Titus</hi> iii. 10. but the <hi>Arrians</hi> and other Hereticks were then ſo numerous and ſo bold, as to hold their Churches, in deſpite of the Eccleſiaſtical cenſures. Whereupon the Orthodox Emperors ſtrengthened the Biſhops Sentences with Secular Laws, and by temporal penalties enjoyned the ſame things which the Biſhops had decreed by Divine Authority, and writ to their Prefects and great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to ſee the inſolence of the Hereticks reſtrained, and that they ſhould turn them out of the Churches by force, from whence the Biſhops had excluded them by their Spiritual ſentence: Now is this to take the Biſhops office and power from them? Yea, is not this the plaineſt evidence the Emperors could give, that they believed the Biſhops had this Power from God, when they make themſelves executioners of their Sentence upon the ſtubborn and refractory? Again, the eldeſt of theſe reſcripts bears date <hi>An.</hi> 381. and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſuppoſes that this power was delegated to the Biſhops by the Emperors long before, and if ſo, how came they now firſt perſonally to exerciſe it? or when did they reaſſume this Power, or take it from the Biſhops again? Did not the Biſhops at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the ſecond general Council this very year, exerciſe this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:205999:50"/>ſame power? Why then ſhould this confirmation of their Sentence, this following their deciſion by a Temporal Law, be ſuppoſed a taking away their power? If we examine the date of that Council, it is plain that the Council was begun in <hi>May,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to <hi>November. An.</hi> 381, as the learned Dr. <hi>Beverege</hi> computes
<note n="(z)" place="margin">Bever. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Tom. 2. p. 89.</note>. But this Law bears date the 4th. of the Ides of <hi>January</hi> following, and under the ſame Conſuls
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Juſtin. Cod. l. 1. tit. I. L. 2. p. 1.</note>. So that the Biſhops had firſt Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated every Hereſy contrary to the Nicene Faith in the firſt Canon of that Council, and then ſome Months after, the Emperor orders his Prefects to ſee their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence executed. Fourthly, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> brings in thoſe Imperial Laws that did allow the Biſhops to be the Judges in all cauſes, if the contending parties conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and alſo thoſe which only permit them to judge cauſes <hi>concerning matters of Religion, or matters between Clergy-men;</hi> and he ſuppoſes the Emperors permitting, enlarging and tempering or reſtraining this ſort of juriſdiction arbitrarily, will prove, that they did the ſame as to Excommunication, which is the principal inſtrument ſerving to this Juriſdiction
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Seld. Synedr. L. I. cap. 10. p. 187, 188, 189, 190.</note>. To which I reply, that the Biſhops had a power of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication long before they had this Juriſdiction; and the one no ways depends on the other; nor do theſe Edicts at all mention the power of Excommunication; Nor was that Power ever limited to be uſed only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Clergy, as this Juriſdiction ſometimes ſeems to have been: And again, if it were only a power to judge cauſes where both Parties were willing, as is clearly expreſſed in the Laws of <hi>Arcadius, Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius, They who will try their cauſes, before them by conſent</hi>

                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:205999:51"/>which they exerciſed againſt Hereticks, and ſuch as were guilty of impieties or immoralities, not againſt thoſe who contended about their Civil Rights. So that all theſe Laws are nothing to the purpoſe; On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may obſerve, That <hi>Conſtantines</hi> firſt Law giving them a general power of hearing all ſorts of Civil cauſes, bears date <hi>An.</hi> 314

<note n="(h)" place="margin">Socrates hiſt. l. 7. cap. 7.</note>. Now I refer it to any indifferent judge, whether it be likely that thoſe Emperors who gave them more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Chriſt had appointed, ſhould take from them an ancient piece of Authority, which theſe Biſhops openly declared they derived from Chriſt, and which they and their Predeceſſors had always enjoyed? Fifthly, He alledges that <hi>Justinian</hi> doth very often in his own name pronounce <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
<note n="(i)" place="margin">Seld. ibid. p. 172.</note>: But this is eaſily anſwered out of the places cited by Mr. <hi>Selden:</hi> For <hi>Juſtinian</hi> declares there <hi>That herein he followed the Apoſtles and the holy Biſhops who ſucceeded them</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Juſtin. Cod. L. l. tit. 1. L. V. praef.</note>; And that he followed <hi>the holy Prieſts herein</hi>

<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid. L. VII. §. 3, 4 &amp; 5.</note>; Yea, he ſaith that all the Biſhops which were preſent had ſubſcribed theſe <hi>Anathema's</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Ibid. L. VII. §. 3. p. 4.</note>. Wherefore this is only a declaration of that Emperors Faith, and an evidence that he held the true Catholick Religion; nor was his putting theſe <hi>Anathema's</hi> into his Edict any exerciſe of the power of Excommunication: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they are levelled at opinions, and not at any particular perſons, This general <hi>Anathema</hi> was not properly a Cenſure, but an high act of deteſtation, declaring the Perſon uſing it abhorred thoſe Opinions, and thought ſuch as held them deſerved to be accurſed, that is, by thoſe who had the Power to pronounce them
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:205999:51"/>ſo judicially. And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> knew this very well; for in the next Page, (Page 173.) he obſerves, that ſome learned Men do diſtinguiſh concerning theſe <hi>Anathema's</hi> uſed by Lay-Men, either in Donations or Laws, and thoſe pronounced by the Clergy; for theſe are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but thoſe of the Laity only ſignify, thoſe that uſe them wiſh ſuch a ſentence might be iſſued out ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually by the Eccleſiaſtical Orders againſt theſe Hereticks; or that they give their aſſent to ſome ſuch ſentence formerly pronounced by theſe Orders; or that they highly deteſt and abhor ſuch perſons and their Opinions; Even as the reconciled <hi>Quartadecimani,</hi> who were Lay-Men, did Anathematize that, and all Hereſies in the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Seld. Synedr. l. I. cap. 10. p. 173. Item Binius Tom. I. par. 2. pag. 260.</note>. Now it would be a very weak aſſertion, to ſay theſe Lay-Men did in this renouncing Hereſy with <hi>Anathema's</hi> exerciſe the office of Biſhops; and yet that is as true and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to think or affirm, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> did take upon him by his own Imperial Authority to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate theſe Hereticks by <hi>Anathema's:</hi> For when the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> was a formal Sentence, it was always pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a Biſhop. Sixthly, his moſt ſpecious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that Novel Conſtitution of <hi>Justinians,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith, <hi>was a Law made by him as the ſupreme Arbiter of Excommunication</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Seld. de Syned. p. 172.</note>: And a little after he cites it at large, and ſpeaks very great things of it
<note n="(q)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 191.</note>; as if the Biſhops by this Law might not Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate otherwiſe than by the rules he preſcribed. And leſt we ſhould ſeem to fear this terrible Law, we will tranſcribe it alſo; the words are theſe, <hi>We for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all Biſhops and Prieſts to exclude any perſon from the holy Communion, before the cauſe be ſhewed for which the Eccleſiaſtical Canons command it to be done.</hi> And if any do exclude any one from the holy Communion on other accounts, <hi>he that is unjuſtly Excommunicated ſhall be abſolved and admitted to the Communion by a greater Priest; And he that preſumed to Excommunicate him ſhall by his ſuperior Prieſt be deprived of the Communion, ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:205999:52"/>as his Superior ſees fit; that what he hath done unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he may ſuffer</hi>

Now for anſwer to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I might reply, that this Law comes too late to wreſt this Divine Right out of the Biſhops hands; for if <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had attempted to take this power from them after 550 years Poſſeſſion, and an Original title from Chriſt and the Apoſtles, it had ſignified no great matter. But if we review the Law, we ſhall find no ſuch thing was deſigned by it: For we ſee he doth not hinder Biſhops to Excommunicate for any offences which the Canons had made liable to that Penalty: And that was all Hereſies and all ſorts of Impiety and Immorality, as might eaſily be proved if need were. And theſe Canons were made by the Biſhops in all Ages: So that this was no abridging of their Liberty; nor were they tyed to any other rules than thoſe of their own and their Predeceſſors making; By which rules Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Schiſmaticks, Murtherers, Adulterers, perjured Perſons, the malicious, the profane, and all ſorts of ſcandalous offenders were to be Excommunicated; and to ſay they muſt cenſure none but theſe is to give them all the liberty Chriſt had allowed them, or their Predeceſſors uſed. And though it be ſaid, <hi>the cauſe muſt be firſt ſhewed;</hi> This doth not mean it muſt be ſhewed to the Emperor or any Secular Magiſtrate, only the Biſhop muſt proceed regularly, and firſt warn the Criminal (as Chriſt himſelf directs, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii) and then convict him of the offence. So that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Excommunicated may know what fault he is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for; which is ſo juſt and reaſonable a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he deſerves not to be truſted with any power of judging by God or Man who will not obſerve this. Nor can Excommunication attain the end which Chriſt appointed it for (even the converſion of the Sinner) unleſs the Biſhop do thus proceed; ſo that Chriſt as well as the Emperor requires this, which implies no more, than that this weighty Cenſure ought not to be raſhly and unjuſtly laid on, contrary to the rules of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:205999:52"/>Chriſt, who was the Author of it, and to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Ancient Church. And for the Emperor to make ſuch a Law doth no more diſprove the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies Divine Right to Excommunicate, than our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Laws (That the Clergy ſhall Pray at ſuch times and in ſuch Geſtures and Habits, and by ſuch a Form agreeable to Gods Word; And that they ſhall Preach in ſuch certain places or on ſuch days, and not vent any Hereſie or Sedition in their Sermons) do prove that our Clergy have not Authority from God to Pray and Preach; and the like may be ſaid of the Sacraments. No doubt the Supream Powers ought to ſee that all Men of all ranks do that duty which God requires of them, orderly, uniformly, and ſo as may be for the common benefit, and in ſo doing they do not invade any Perſons Right. 'Tis true, if that Emperor had forbid the Biſhops to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate any Man for any Cauſe, (as he that gives may take away a Delegated Power) or if our Laws ſhould wholly forbid the Clergy to Pray, Preach or Adminiſter the Sacraments, then the Divine Right would be invaded; but not when they only direct us to exerciſe our Power wiſely, orderly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably: This is no more than for the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <hi>to make a Hedge for Gods Law,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, and indeed argues very well againſt this falſe inference of his own
<note n="(s)" place="margin">Seld: lib. 1. cap. 10. pag. 277 &amp; pag. 288.</note>. Beſides after all this flouriſh, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> well knew, that this Law is no other than what the Canons of the Church had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed before <hi>Juſtinians</hi> time; For the Famous Canons of <hi>Carthage</hi> do Ordain, <hi>That no Biſhop ſhall raſhly or lightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive any one of the Communion, nor for any fault only known to him by the private Confeſſion of the parties</hi>

We may now leave this Objection, when we have obſerved, that this Novel doth not make the Emperor Judge, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of this raſhneſs, but the Metropolitan, he is to Excommunicate the unjuſt Excommunicator, not the Emperor; which ſhews, that the offending Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop did not act by a Delegate Power, for if he had, the Emperor would have been the puniſher; and if ever any Emperor ſhould have Excommunicated, this had been a fit occaſion when the Biſhops abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the power they gave them; but Lo, here is none mentioned to execute this Sentence, but the offenders own Metropolitan, one of his own Order: And therefore this Novel Conſtitution plainly ſuppoſes, none but one of the Clergy could Excommunicate; and this added to what we noted before concerning the French Capitular, forbidding raſh Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, is a full reply to this ſeemingly formidable Objection. There are ſome other ſlight Objections relating to theſe times, which we will briefly here ſet down. Firſt, he would prove the Chriſtian Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication to be the ſame with the Jewiſh, from the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Seld. Synedr. lib. 1. cap. 13. pag. 272 &amp; 276.</note>, but who knows not, that very many words which had been uſed by the Jews, were taken up by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and uſed in a different ſenſe from that which they Originally ſignified? So the Fathers uſe the Word <hi>Paſſover,</hi> not for the Jewiſh Feaſt upon their Paſchal Lamb, but for the Chriſtian Feſtival in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Chriſts Reſurrection; So alſo they uſe the word <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> for the Commemoration of Chriſts one Oblation in the Euchariſt, not for a real Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifice. The like might be obſerved of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Words, <hi>viz. Apoſtle, Baptiſm, Presbyter, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:205999:53"/>which were Jewiſh Phraſes, but uſed by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in a quite different ſenſe. Wherefore ſuppoſing <gap reason="foreign">

Again, He objects that a certain Monk did Excommunicate the younger <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who would not be ſatisfied till <hi>the ſame Monk had abſolved him</hi>
                  <note n="(x)" place="margin">Idem lib. 1. cap. 10. pag. 171. è Theodoret. lib. 5. cap. 36.</note>; And hence he infers, that others beſides Biſhops may Excommunicate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any formal proceſs, as the Cuſtom was among the latter Jews. I reply, this bold Fact being a ſingle Inſtance, is no Argument that ſuch a thing might lawfully be done; yea, the Patriarchs Opinion was, that the Emperor needed no Abſolution from ſo raſh a Sentence. And it was in Compliance with the Emperors fears, that this abſolution was procured; yet it is not improbable this Monk was in Prieſts Orders, becauſe <hi>Theodoſius</hi> deſires the Patriarch, to give him Licence to looſe the Bond who had laid it on; However if the Monks zeal tranſported him beyond the bounds of his Duty, that is no ground of Argument nor Precedent for us to follow. He alſo objects the ſaying of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> upon that place of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> xvi. 19. concerning the power of <hi>Bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looſing; Which words (S.</hi> Hierom <hi>ſaith) ſome Biſhops and Prieſts not understanding, Phariſaically thought they could condemn the Innocent, or abſolve the Guilty; whereas before God the Life of the Criminal is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rather than the Sentence of the Prieſt.</hi> And he goes on to compare this with the Office of the Levitical Prieſts, who did not make the Leprous clean or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but diſcern and declare who were ſo; and ſaith, in like manner the Prieſts and Biſhops now, do not by <hi>Binding or Looſing</hi> make Men Guilty or Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but by vertue of their Office diſcern and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare who are really ſo
<note n="(y)" place="margin">Seld. Syn. lib. 1. cap. 13. pag. 285. ex Hieron. Com. in Matth. 16.</note>. And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> thinks this argues that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> did not think Chriſt had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:205999:54"/>given the Clergy ſuch a Juriſdiction as they claim from theſe words. I Anſwer, that we do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any ſuch Power, as to condemn the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or clear the Guilty; but Grant <hi>that God doth not always follow the Judgment of the Church, which may be impoſed on ſometimes</hi>

I find no more Objections relating to Ancient times, and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> proceeds from thence to affirm, That the <hi>French</hi> Emperors in the <hi>Weſt</hi> did order, limit, permit or reſtrain Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

There remain only two particulars not conſidered before, the Firſt is that Article of Peace between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Princes, An. 860. Whereby it is agreed with the conſent of divers Biſhops, <hi>That no Offenders ſhall be Excommunicated till the Biſhop, according to the Goſpel Precept have admoniſhed him to repent; and if he refuſe this Admonition, complaint is to be made to the King or his Officers, to compel him to ſubmit to penance, and to amend; and if this will not prevail, then the Offender is to be Excommunicated for his Souls health</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Seld. Synedr. lib. 1. cap. 10. pag. 192.</note>. Which Law doth ſuppoſe the Biſhops power of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication grounded on S. <hi>Math.</hi> xviii. And ſince Chriſt there directs all poſſible means to be uſed to bring the Sinner to Repentance, before he be put into the State of a Heathen and Publican; I do not ſee but this Law proceeds upon the ſame ground; and no doubt in that Age they did believe Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a dreadful thing, ſince it was the higheſt penalty and laſt remedy to be uſed: So that this doth not prove the Power of Excommunication was not Originally in the Biſhops by the Grant of Chriſt; but only that it was ſo dreadful in its effects, that all other ways were firſt to be tryed towards Offenders: Yet withal, if we conſider the Law well, we ſhall ſee the Civil Authority is complained unto, only to bring the Offender to ſubmit to Eccleſiaſtical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, not to take the cauſe out of the Biſhops hands. The ſecond particular is that place cited by <hi>Ivo Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notenſis</hi> out of the Capitulars, <hi>That if the King receive any of the Offenders to his Favour, or admit them to his Table, The Prieſts and Chriſtian Aſſemblies ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe into Eccleſiaſtical Communion; that he who is reconciled to the Prince, may not be kept at a diſtance

                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Seld. ut ſup. cap. 10. pag. 193, 194.</note>. Where Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that Kings ſhould have ſuch a power of Abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in an Age, when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> dared to Excommunicate them: And it were a greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if this Cuſtom ſhould prove that Biſhops had not the power of <hi>Binding and Looſing</hi> by Divine Right, ſince it was ſo generally believed they had this right in that Age, wherein it is ſaid this Cuſtom was in uſe: Wherefore it muſt be obſerved, firſt that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> Confeſſes, it was a Pagan rite (mentioned in <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>) for Kings to give a ſort of Abſolution to involuntary Slayers of Men, by admitting them to their Table; And this Cuſtom was in <hi>France</hi> before the Kings became Chriſtian, as ſeems probable by that example of King <hi>Guntram</hi>'s receiving a Biſhop to his Favour, that had been. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for ſuſpicion of Treaſon; upon which he was (without any Judgment of a Synod) reſtored to his Biſhoprick

So that it is probable enough, thoſe Princes after their Converſion might retain this Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Cuſtom, and that whether the Biſhops would or no; in which caſe there can no good Argument be drawn from a Heathen Cuſtom, obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a People lately Barbarous, to invalidate the Law of Chriſt: But we need not fly to that refuge; For theſe <hi>(Culpati) Offenders,</hi> here mentioned, are not <hi>all Excommunicate Perſons,</hi> but only ſuch as were Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for Treaſon: To prove which we muſt obſerve, that in the fourth Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops began to pronounce moſt dreadful Anathema's againſt ſuch as broke their Oath of Allegiance, and Rebelled againſt their King
<note n="(f)" place="margin">An. 633. Concil. 4. Tolet. Can. 75. Bin. Tom. II. par. 2. pag. 357.</note>; Which kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema or Sentence of Greater Excommunication was alſo uſed afterwards in the Eaſtern Empire

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:205999:55"/>offended: And to prove this we need go no further than the third Canon of the Twelfth Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> (out of which this Law of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulars is <hi>verbatim</hi> tranſcribed, and of which it is an Abbreviation) the words of which are; <hi>We ſee with grief ſome of the offenders</hi> (Ex numero Culpato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum) <hi>received into the Princes favour, but remaining Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the College of Prieſts, which evil is cauſed by the liberty Princes take to oblige others to what themſelves will not obſerve, ſo that they will eat and converſe with thoſe which they have cauſed to be ſeparated from the Church; But becauſe the remiſſion of thoſe things they do againſt the King and Country is by the former Canons</hi>

                  <hi>reſerved to the Prince alone, againſt whom they have offended; therefore hereafter in this Caſe no Prieſt ſhall forbear Communion with them, but thoſe whom the King receives to his favour or admits to his Table, &amp;c.</hi> juſt in the words of the Capitular cited above
<note n="(i)" place="margin">An. 681. Concil. XII. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. Can. 3. Bin. Tom. III. par. 1. pag. 272.</note>. Whence we may obſerve that theſe offenders were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rebels, and if the King would pardon theſe, there was no reaſon the Church ſhould keep them Excommunicated, when they had ſatisfied the party offended; this being no more than what is granted to a private Perſon, whoſe complaint cauſes any Man to be Cenſured by the Church; to whom if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender make ſatisfaction, the Church will withdraw the Sentence. And one thing more is plain by this Canon, that the Biſhops by a Canon of a former Council had granted the Kings this priviledge to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit ſuch as offended againſt their Crown; ſo that the power in the Prince was by Delegation from the Biſhops at firſt, and therefore this can never prove the Biſhops acted by Delegation from the King, in the Caſe of Excommunicating and Abſolving; And if any do wonder the Biſhops ſhould give the King this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, they muſt conſider, that every Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Perſon ought to be abſolved when he gives good Evidence of his Repentance; and becauſe a Rebel
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:205999:56"/>can give no greater Teſtimony of his Repentance, than ſo to carry himſelf as to get the Kings Pardon, therefore on this Evidence the Offender was to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, yet ſo as (by this Canon it appears) the Biſhops Abſolution was to follow the Kings Pardon, before the Criminal could enjoy the liberty <hi>of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Communion.</hi> Theſe are all the Objections which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> can meet with in Antiquity, to oppoſe our Aſſertion, all which we have fully conſidered; and now we ſhould alſo examine thoſe which he brings for later times out of the Laws, Statutes, and Uſages of Modern Kingdoms within the laſt 500 or 600 years: But before we anſwer theſe Allegations, we will premiſe a few things: Firſt, That if Chriſt granted and the Church enjoyed this power for above 1000 years together, the Laws and Uſages of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Countries afterwards, cannot deprive the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of this right, though they ſhould expreſly decree it. Secondly, That the Roman Church in theſe later times did ſo abuſe this Sacred Cenſure, proſtituting it to ſerve the ends of Avarice and Ambition, and making it a Secular Engine to advance themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Temporal Power and Poſſeſſions; yea, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Governments of all Nations with their ill management of this once Divine Sentence, that it is no wonder if Princes did uſe all means to remedy this evil, and for their own ſafety and the quiet of their Kingdoms committed to them by God, did frequently prohibit theſe proceedings. Thirdly, that in ſo doing they did not oppoſe Chriſts Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only the groſs abuſe of it to ends for which our Lord never did deſign it; So that they did not meddle with that part of Excommunication, which purely aimed at the Converſion of Criminals, and the Reformation of Manners; they did not oppoſe or check the Biſhops in the Spiritual part of their Office, in doing as the Primitive Paſtors did; but only when they uſed their power for Secular ends; And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:205999:56"/>all the difference between the Empire and the Prieſthood was concerning ſome outward Appendixes to Excommunication annexed by the favour of devout Princes, which being abuſed by the Eccleſiaſticks, Princes would have taken away again, or limited ſo as they might not be a grievance to them and their Subjects: But the power it ſelf as Chriſt gave it, no King ever attempted to take away; and therefore theſe inſtances will not much concern my Opinion who am pleading only for the Primitive ſort of Excommunication, attended with thoſe modern circumſtances as it is exerciſed in the reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> where it never did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Government, but is rather very uſeful to it. <hi>De Marca</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>there is a deep ſilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients, about the Churches invading the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Prince, for the ancient Biſhops only minded to keep up the Canonical diſcipline</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:205999:57"/>Diſcipline to be exerciſed in ſuch Caſes, wherein the Law of God and the example of the Apoſtles required it ſhould be uſed; and if King <hi>William</hi> had forbid any ſuch thing, his prohibition had been impious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, as being againſt the expreſs Law of God. But for that cuſtom of the Biſhops acquainting the King firſt, before any ſuch Sentence were iſſued out againſt his chief Officers, there ſeems to be ſome reaſon for it: Firſt, Becauſe the King is ſuppoſed to be able to bring theſe to amendment, without any ſeverity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in that age many things were annexed to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication by Princes bounty to the Church; ſo that if this Perſon were one of whom the King had great need in his Affairs, he might thus have become uſeleſs to him on the ſudden, to the great dammage of his Government. Thirdly, The Prince himſelf might thus unwarily become lyable to Excommunication, by converſing with the Excommunicate: So that this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom requires notice be given to the Prince firſt, and with his leave the Offender may be Excommunicated. Nor ought we to ſuppoſe that any Chriſtian Prince, who ſaw a good Biſhop only deſigning reformation of ſome ſcandalous Officer or Servant of his, would deny his leave for the Biſhop to cenſure him; and if he did, I dare venture to ſay, <hi>Might overcomes Right.</hi> For I am not of Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> Opinion, That Secular Laws and Cuſtoms are always juſt; but I believe pious Biſhops have often for peace ſake ſubmitted to unjuſt Laws and Cuſtoms both, rather than diſturb their Country, or raiſe Sedition againſt their Prince. Again, He objects divers Sentences of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denounced in Parliament againſt the infringers of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other Liberties of the Church and People. I reply, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> grants this is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Excommunicating, but only a Threatning of this Sentence in general, and a declaration that they all believe the Perſon ſo offending deſerves to be Accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Excommunicated by the Biſhops: and ſince ſo
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:205999:57"/>many Biſhops were preſent in Parliament, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was theirs properly, and the reſt only expreſſed their agreement to it: And withal, Excommunication was by the conſequents attending it, even as to a Mans outward condition, become one of the moſt grievous Penalties of all others in this Age; and ſo it is no wonder if Princes, who had annexed theſe Conſequences to it, did oblige the Clergy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it with general aſſent on ſolemn occaſions, to make their Laws the better to be obſerved: Though I am apt to queſtion, whether it were well done to uſe it to ſuch Secular purpoſes. We have indeed one Statute ſince the Reformation (objected alſo by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>)
<note n="(n)" place="margin">Stat. 5 &amp; 6 Edvard. 6. Cap. 4. Vide Seld. ut ſupr. pag. 173.</note> which decrees Excommunication for ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church or Church-yard; but this is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Law made by the Biſhops conſent, but alſo it relates to a matter of the Church, and is no more but a confirmation of divers ancient Canons, which they ſuppoſed would be better obſerved, if the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did aſſent to them, and paſs them into a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Law, as was often done by the Primitive Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Civil Law, and by the French Kings in the Capitulars; but neither they, nor our Parliament, ever intended hereby to take the matter out of the Clergies power, or to aſſume this power into their own hands; Yea, the Statute cited, expreſly ſaith, The Ordinary ſhall iſſue out the Sentence. Again, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith, The Kings of <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. do allow Appeals from the Biſhops Conſiſtory in many caſes. I reply, That many caſes are tryed in that Court by the pious favour of Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who truly believed Biſhops fitteſt to judge in cauſes concerning Teſtaments, Legacies, Guardianſhip, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now in theſe matters, which are judged by Biſhops, not by any expreſs Law of God, but by favour of the Prince, he may ſee that Biſhops judge rightly, and therefore the King did of old grant Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions on great occaſions, and call ſome of theſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:205999:58"/>matters into his Temporal Courts, where anciently he ſat himſelf; which Cuſtom being confirmed by time, is practiſed to this day; but this no way concerns the Biſhops Authority which Chriſt gave him; and if the Sentence be for Hereſie, or any other Scandalous Offence, for which of old Excommunication was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; or if it only tend to reformation of Manners, and to the Salvation of the Criminals Soul, no Appeal lyes. So that our opinion of the Divine Right of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is not diſproved by theſe proceedings. But he argues further, That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ſome times ſent out their Writs to command Biſhops to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their Excommunications, of which he gives ſome inſtances
<note n="(o)" place="margin">Seld. Synedr. lib. I. cap. 10. pag. 201. &amp;c.</note>. To this I reply, That all the caſes he ſpecifies, are notorious violations of that power which Chriſt had entruſted the Biſhops with, tending to the hindring the King Precepts from being executed, and to the oppreſſion of his Loyal Subjects. Now ſince the King is, and ought to be Supreme in all Cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil, no doubt it is his Office and Duty to ſee that all Perſons do rightly uſe the power they have, and if they abuſe it, he may hinder them or puniſh them for it; and in ſo doing he doth not take away the Power it ſelf from thoſe who uſe it well, nor deny it to come Originally from Chriſt: As if a King do impriſon or baniſh a Prieſt for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sedition, none will ſay that he thereby denies any Prieſt to have a power from Chriſt to preach good Doctrine. And truly, if the Clergy do abuſe their power, they ought to be corrected for it; for our Saviour, who ſet up Kings as well as Prieſts, and made Princes the Supreme, never intended to give his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters any power to diſturb the Publick Peace, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the good Government of the World: And if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had not power to hinder ſuch unjuſt Sentences, they could not govern their Kingdoms, nor do their duty. And when the Pope and his Clergy ſtrove with Kings for the Supremacy, it was high time for them to check theſe dangerous attempts, or elſe they would
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:205999:58"/>not have ſitten any longer in their Thrones than the Pope pleaſed: But all this is now out of doors, and therefore the objection ſignifies nothing as to our Proteſtant Biſhops exerciſing this Authority, becauſe they yield the King the Supremacy in all Cauſes, as the Primitive Biſhops did. And even in Popiſh times, though the Kings did prohibit the abuſe of this power, yet at the ſame time they owned the Right to be ſolely in the Biſhops: For <hi>Edward</hi> the third, (whom Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> inſtances in) did <hi>by his Letters requeſt</hi> John Stratford <hi>Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and the rest of the Biſhops of his Kingdom, to Excommunicate all notorious Malefactors and Diſturbers of the Peace of Church and State; which requeſt they granted in a Council at</hi> London

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:205999:60"/>have claimed as belonging to them of Divine Right in all Ages, and upon that Principle have uſed it, in Cenſuring notorious Offenders, by excluding them from Civil and Sacred Commerce, to bring them to ſhame, and ſo to Repentance and Amendment of Life: And their Sentence, when pronounced according to the Rules of the Goſpel on the Sinful and Contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hath been feared by all orderly Chriſtians as a Sentence which God will ratifie, and which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance will deliver over the Criminal to his Eternal Vengeance.</p>
               <p>§. VI. The third particular propoſed concerning the ends for which Excommunication was inſtituted, having been often touched at already, may now ſerve for a Concluſion: And there are three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ends of this holy Rite, as may be gathered from the Scripture. Firſt, it was inſtituted for the honour of Chriſt and his Church, and the Credit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: Our Lord himſelf was pure from all Sin, his Religion obligeth all that profeſs it <hi>to depart from all Iniquity</hi>

There will be offenders and offences, but if the Church do admoniſh the Criminals, and Cenſure them publickly, that clears her from all ſuſpicion of Guilt, and from all juſt ground of Calumny, and preſerves not only her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but her Reputation. It was the great Honour of <hi>Sparta,</hi> as a Senator there ſaid, <hi>That none could be Wicked in that City and be unpuniſhed:</hi> And this Diſcipline kept up the Credit of the Ancient Church for many Ages, ſo that its very Enemies did admire it, and Millions of Proſelytes came over to it; But when this Primitive Diſcipline did abate,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:205999:61"/>the Church evidently decayed in its eſteem as well as its Manners. And this is but too plainly verified in our days, for ſince theſe Cenſures have been brought into Contempt, we are almoſt overwhelmed with a Flood of thoſe Wickedneſſes which the Secular Laws ſeldom Puniſh; Adultery, Fornication and Inceſt, Drunkenneſs, Blaſphemy and Swearing, Sacriledge, Faction and Malice
<note n="(k)" place="margin">Canon. 109. Can. 4, 6, 7. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric. before the Commun.</note>, which are properly of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Cognizance, are grown ſo common and ſo da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that they have brought an infinite diſgrace and a deplorable Scandal on our moſt holy Religion: This drives ſome from the Church, hardens other in their Sinful Separation, and opens the Mouths of all our Adverſaries, as if they juſtly left that Church where ſuch Wickedneſs goes unpuniſhed. 'Tis true, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is as ill grounded as their Separation: For they may be as virtuous as they pleaſe in a Church wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are vitious, and while wickedneſs diſpleaſeth them, it cannot hurt them; for <hi>Lot</hi> was innocent in <hi>Sodom</hi> ſo long as he was vexed at the Converſation of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 7, 8. And beſides it is not the Churches fault that theſe Crimes are not amended, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be as free of the blame as it is of the Guilt of this Impunity: The Prieſts lament it and complain of it, The Biſhops do all they can to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe growing Evils, but being Judges they muſt not be Informers; And one Cauſe of this miſchief, is the neglect of preſenting ſuch Offenders to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Tribunals. Thoſe whoſe Office it is, though ſolemnly ſworn to do it, yet for fear of the Rich and in favour to the Poor, neglect this uſeful duty, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to offend God by Perjury, and to offend the Church by being the cauſe of this Scandal, than to diſoblige their vicious Neighbours: But if they would Preſent them, then if they be not either amended or caſt out of the Society, the fault would lye at the Churches door. I know theſe Officers excuſe their negligence and Perjury by pretending, that ſometimes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:205999:61"/>the Criminals get off by Money or Friends, and then they are expoſed to their revenge for being Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to their Conviction. But our Biſhops do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after, and puniſh this Male-Adminiſtration whenſoever they diſcover it; and I know it is their deſire and endeavour that no Scandalous offender ſhall get looſe from this ſalutary Bond, till they have given good evidence of their ſorrow for their fault, their purpoſes of amendment, and their Charity to ſuch as were inſtrumental to their Reformation. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the long diſuſe of open Penance, to which of Old the greateſt Perſonages were forced to ſubmit
<note n="(l)" place="margin">Vid. exempl. in vitâ Henric. Chicheley pag. 21.</note>, hath made it unhappily neceſſary to accept Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations in many Caſes, and the charge makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forſake the Sin: But I dare affirm this courſe is taken, not becauſe of the eaſineſs of the Clergy, but becauſe of the ſtubbornneſs of the Laity, who will not ſubmit to a Penance, which only declares what they really are, and what they are known to be; who hate not to be Wicked, but only to be thought ſo; and who refuſe to take a little Temporal ſhame, though it would reſcue them from Eternal ſhame: And I fear if our zealous Biſhops ſhould attempt a vigorous Reformation, there would be ſome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtudy Evaſions, and to encourage the Offenders to deſpiſe the Methods of their cure; Others who reckon it their higheſt Priviledge to be wicked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul, would exclaim againſt this as a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Liberties: As the Vicious Monks and Lay-men of Old, when that Pious and Zealous Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln Robert Groſthead</hi> conſcientiouſly ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on viſiting and reforming his Dioceſs, Openly reviled him <hi>for making ſo ſtrict an enquiry by his Archdeacons and Rural Deans through his Biſhoprick, into the Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and manners of both Noble and Ignoble; they called it Tyrannizing over his People, and bringing a grievous Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal upon many, to the Detriment of their good Name, which ought not to be done</hi>
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">An. 1246. Matth. Paris, pag. 716.</note>. And at laſt they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:205999:62"/>a Prohibition to hinder that good Biſhop in his proceedings, on pretence it tended to the diſgrace of many; As if the Plaiſter, and not the Sword which made the wound, muſt be blamed for the painfulneſs of the Cure; and as if it were not more diſgrace to be really wicked, than to be cenſured for it in order to our amendment. To conclude, the Church muſt either be allowed freely to uſe her Diſcipline, or excuſed from the Scandal ſhe ſuffers by the encreaſe of notorious Sins: But ſhe will never regain her Primitive Honour till this Divine Rite be reſtored to its ancient vigour, for our Lord did inſtitute it for the Credit and Reputation of his pure and holy Religion, and if it were duly uſed, it would certainly have that bleſſed effect.</p>
               <p>The ſecond end of Excommunication is the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Offender here, and his Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereafter, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> in many places doth declare

For firſt, Shame is not only the deſert but the natural Conſequence of Sin; All good and Wiſe Men, who are the beſt Judges, count the vitious, vile and baſe, fooliſh and wretched perſons, and ſo long as Men have any ſenſe of Honour loft, the apprehenſion of this diſgrace will make deep impreſſions on them

But few have arrived at this height of Impiety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Method will work upon all that have any ſpark of goodneſs left. For doubtleſs it is a moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing for a Chriſtian ſo to behave himſelf, as by Chriſts Law and by thoſe who judge in his ſtead, to be openly Sentenced as unworthy to remain in the Church, or to have any Converſation with the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People; yet this ſhame is moſt juſt, they have ſhamed the Church by their Vices, and ought to be put to ſhame before the whole Congregation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 6. and it is a bleſſed ſhame if it bring the Offender to a ſorrow for his Sin, and to amendment of Life. Secondly, if the Sinner be not wrought on by Shame, perhaps Fear may bring him to Repentance, and this Fear is apt to be produced by this Cenſure rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: There is nothing hardens Evil Men more than the forgetting that eternal Vengeance which their Sins deſerve; But this dreadful Sentence is an Emblem and a forerunner of the terrible Judgment at the laſt day: It ſets Hell and Damnation naked before their Eyes; This caſting out of the Church clearly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents their being caſt out of Heaven; and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them to Sathan, foreſhews to whoſe power they are like to be doomed by God and his Holy Angels. It may be they have ſupported themſelves with vain hopes hitherto, but for the Phyſician to declare us mortally ſick, or the Lawyer to aſſure us our cauſe is deſperate, will ſtagger the moſt daring confidence; Much more ought it to make us tremble, when he that judges in Chriſts Name and by his Authority, he whoſe Sentence on Earth is confirmed by his great Maſter in Heaven, ſhall pronounce us worthy of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205999:63"/>Burnings, and deliver us over to them, unleſs we repent immediately. This proſpect doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten terrifie the moſt obdurate and preſumptuous Sinners; and it would more conſtantly have this Bleſſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if the Sentence were pronounced with the ſame gravity as it was wont to be of old; and if all the Congregation out of a deep ſenſe of the woful Eſtate of the Excommunicate Perſon would expreſs their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for him by tears and a viſible Sorrow. And ſince this Holy Cenſure is ſo ſit an Inſtrument to convert obſtinate Sinners, we ought highly to eſteem it, and to take care that by our ill-management of it it do not loſe its deſired effect.</p>
               <p>The third end of Excommunication is to preſerve the ſound from being corrupted by the example and the Converſation of Scandalous Sinners; Which we learn from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> compariſons of <hi>the leaven to be purged out, leſt it ſpread over the whole maſs,</hi> 1 Cor. v. 6, 7. and the gangrened Limb which is to be cut off leſt it corrupt the ſound parts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 7.

Now it is very ſtrange, that neither the Laws of God, the Practice nor Canons of the Primitive Church, nor the Laws of our own Country, can reſtrain us in this moſt Licentious Age, from freely converſing with ſuch Offenders; By which we do not only obſtruct one of thoſe ends, for which Chriſt inſtituted this Holy Rite, but harden the Sinners in their Impenitence, and expoſe our ſelves to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being corrupted by the Converſation of theſe

But our Spiritual Paſtors by their Cenſures do all they can to ſeparate the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the ſound, and by obſerving this Order and flying their Company we ſhall be ſafe. If they ſhould ſuffer notorious Sinners to paſs without a Mark ſet on them, we might have ſome excuſe; but when they are condemned, our ruine is wilful if we aſſociate with them. However it is juſt and neceſſary the Church ſhould ſentence open and Notorious Sinners, leſt their impunity ſhould embolden others to commit the like Crimes, till the number of Offenders made them inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and incorrigible; <hi>He that puniſhes one</hi> (ſaith the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi> Proverb) <hi>threatens an hundred:</hi> And ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of exemplary juſtice done upon ſome of the moſt noted and publick Offenders, will be a means to check theſe growing Evils, and be a warning to others not to fall into thoſe Sins, for which Chriſt and his Church hath appointed ſo ſevere and dreadful a penalty.</p>
               <p>Finally, ſince Excommunication was ſo certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt for theſe excellent ends, Let all Chriſtians in their places labour that it may obtain them: Let the Magiſtrates (according as the Law requires) compel the obſtinate to ſubmit to this Medicine for their Souls. Let the Biſhops, to whom this Diſcipline is committed, uſe it only on great and juſt occaſions; and with ſuch deliberation and ſolemnity that it may make a due impreſſion upon ſuch as fall under it. Let ſuch as ſuffer it, be angry at nothing but the Sin which brought it on them, and ſubmit to a little ſhame here, to reſcue them from Eternal ſhame hereafter; let them with Tears, Faſting and Prayers, ſeek the Peace of God and his Church, looking on themſelves to be (as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are) in a damnable condition till they be abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And let all others fly thoſe Sins which will bring
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:205999:64"/>this Curſe on them; and while they avoid the company of the Excommunicate, let them pity and pray for them, and encourage them to a ſpeedy Repentance: And let none dare to vilifie or deſpiſe this Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, for this is to deſpiſe Chriſt himſelf, and to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Sinners to their Eternal Damnation; yea, it is to hinder the effect of one of the moſt powerful means to convert Sinners, and to curb thoſe Wickedneſſes which are the ſhame of our Religion, and the ruin of many Souls. The poor Greeks believe from very many credible Examples, that ſuch as dye Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate are accurſed by God; and that their Bodies grow black in the Grave, and ſwelled like a Drum, ſo that they cannot rot till they be abſolved

From whence we may learn how evil Inſtruments they are, who by falſe arguings and manifeſt miſtakes do go about to teach Men to deſpiſe this ſacred Diſcipline; And ſince the reſtoring it to its Primitive eſteem is ſo excellent a means to convert Sinners, and extirpate all notorious Vices, to repair the honour of God and Religion, and to wipe off the Scandals which this Church hath ſuffered by the Wickedneſs of its Members, and the Malice of its Enemies; I hope this will be thought a uſeful and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable diſcourſe; for I have therein proved this great Truth, That Excommunication is undoubtedly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and expreſs Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Holy Scripture.</p>
